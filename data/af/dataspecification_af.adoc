== How to read the document?

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities â€“ Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.0 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _TWG AF_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services â€“ General Executive Summary

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services,] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML â€“ Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities â€“ Executive Summary

The data specification for _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ is required to facilitate the interoperability of geographical information related to these topics among member states. In the context of this data specification _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ concern the description of all the physical instruments and constructions with permanent or semi permanent emplacement (inland or outland) that are related to Agricultural and Aquaculture Activities. The general scope has been extended beyond the scope of the term "facility" in order to allow the inclusion of information about delimited portions of land or water related to Agricultural and Aquaculture activities that are subjected by law to special permission, monitoring or management ("plots"). The intention is to cover the potential lacks in the scope of other Thematic working groups also covering Agricultural or Aquaculture concepts but with a different level of detail. Mainly it could be possible to define that _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ scope covers all the terms related to the Agricultural and Aquaculture activities in which is possible to identify a legal responsible for their management or operation.

Although the title of the thematic group involves two different concepts, Agricultural and Aquaculture, both scopes have been included on the same conceptual model. This is because the model has been defined based on the abstractions of geographical entities required by the legislation. In that sense, in the model Agricultural Holding is defined at the same level than Aquaculture Holding being able to identify separately through the Activity performed (attribute). The same rule applies to other levels of detail like installations.

This data specification does not include information related to areas of management that involve sets of holdings grouped by different criteria (areas affected by diseases) or classification of the land (urban and rural planning) which should be covered by other INSPIRE thematic areas.

The thematic scope of this data specification is aimed to provide a solid framework for mapping, reporting and modelling purposes. This is necessary to support policy formulation through better reporting and management of pan European initiatives, such as waste management, water, animal movements, epidemiological control, food traceability, etc where _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ data fulfils a function in relating information to real world objects.

The _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ theme concerns the physical elements related with these kinds of activities. It does not define attributes that should be reported and, as a consequence, it should not be considered in isolation from other INSPIRE themes or reporting obligations as described by other legislations. It is also acknowledged that the model might be extended with further user requirements identified in the future.

Considering the relevance of the Agricultural and Aquaculture activities over the territory and in consequence over the environment, the thematic working group (TWG) has decided to include the geographic description of different entities from simple installations to plots; it is expected that relevant developments such as the European WISE and SEIS projects will use this specification as a base for further extension with reporting obligations within the EU.

The data specification has been prepared by the thematic working group on _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_, a multinational team of experts in the field drawn from all parts of the European Union. Their brief has been to create a specification, which requires no additional data capture by member states, and is in addition, easily understood and as flexible as possible. In this way it is designed to minimize the effort required to supply conformant data.

The data specification has been based on existing standards, as far as possible.

== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_.

=== Informal description

[.underline]#*Definition:*#

(INSPIRE, 2007) Farming equipment and production facilities (including irrigation systems, greenhouses and stables). [Directive 2007/2/EC]

[.underline]#*Description:*#

The scope of "_Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_" thematic working group refers to all the physical instruments and constructions with permanent or semi-permanent emplacement (inland or outland) that are related to Agricultural and Aquaculture Activities (under the NACE Classification â€“ level A - "Agriculture, forestry and fishing"). Including:


* A - Agriculture, forestry and fishing
** A1 - Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities
*** A1.1 - Growing of non-perennial crops
*** A1.2 - Growing of perennial crops
*** A1.3 - Plant propagation
*** A1.4 - Animal production
*** A1.5 - Mixed farming
*** A1.6 - Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities
* ...
* A3 - Fishing and aquaculture
** ...
** A3.2 - Aquaculture
*** A3.2.1 - Marine aquaculture
*** A3.2.2 - Freshwater aquaculture


Activities listed below such as catching, hunting, fishing or collection of natural resources (vegetables or animal) on their natural environment could be included under the scope when supported by relevant physical instruments and constructions but always constraining the information to them as required on Data Specifications. Entities referring extended areas should be considered under most appropriate themes as (AM, SU or CP). These could be:


** A3.1 - Fishing
*** A3.1.1 - Marine fishing
*** A3.1.2 - Freshwater fishing
** ...
** A1.7 - Hunting, trapping and related service activities
*** A1.7.0 - Hunting, trapping and related service activities
* A2 - Forestry and logging
** A2.1 - Silviculture and other forestry activities
*** A2.1.0 - Silviculture and other forestry activities
** A2.2 - Logging
*** A2.2.0 - Logging
** A2.3 - Gathering of wild growing non-wood products
*** A2.3.0 - Gathering of wild growing non-wood products
** A2.4 - Support services to forestry
*** A2.4.0 - Support services to forestry

Under the Agricultural and Aquaculture scope, "Facility" is considered as a generic term that refers to physical structures or sets of them designed, built or installed to serve a specific function (agricultural or aquaculture) and areas of land or water where such structures are or may be located. Based on this generic definition, the scope covers a wide range of entities from Holdings to Abstract Installations (Specific Technical Units).

"Facilities" dedicated to the optimal conservation of materials directly derived from Agricultural or Aquaculture Activities and placed into the "Site" limits of the "Holding" in which these materials have been produced are covered by the scope (e.g. Milk raw tanks). "Facilities" related to Activities of marketing and transformation of raw materials into elaborated products in an industrial way would be under the scope of other themes (PF, US, BU), similar case occurs for those activities carried out on the Holding - Site but not directly related to Agricultural or Aquaculture activities as they have been described and without a relevant impact on the environment (e.g. hosting of persons or recreational activities), .

All the "facilities" where animals are bred or kept for uses not directly related to Agriculture or Aquaculture activities would be under the scope if existing datasets related to agricultural or aquaculture include them because of their purposes (e.g. for the purpose of "epidemiological control of animal diseases" equestrian centers may be included).

All physical instruments and constructions that are part of the rural landscape but not legally related to specific agricultural or aquaculture holdings (related party - operator) could be included under the scope but always constraining the information to them as required on Data Specifications..

All the geographical entities delimiting areas in which holdings are grouped by different criteria shall be under the scope of other themes (AM, HH, SU) (e.g relaying areas, infected zones or compartment, irrigation areas,...).

The extended part of the model includes delimited portions of land or water ("plots") in which agricultural (including animal farming) and/or aquaculture labours are carried out. The scope was extended to this class beyond the scope of the term "facility" in order to cover "Data Set" dealing with information about actions over delimited extensions of territory (inland or on water) related to Agricultural and Aquaculture activities and under the direct supervision or responsibility of a "Holding" that are subjected by law to special permission, monitoring or management. The intention is to cover the potential lack of other scopes like Land Use or Land Cover in which the figure of the "Related Party - Operator" is not considered.

[.underline]#*Scope, use examples:*#

Agricultural and Aquaculture Holdings (_Activity Complex_ Extension as described in Doc 2.10 "INSPIRE Base Models") as human activities taking place over the territory, are directly related to the environment in which they are located (land, water and air); in that context, they are subject to diverse legislation (from Local to European).

As Economical Activities, they are subjected to a wide range of common legislation derived from their operations (waste, e-prtr, seveso, water,...). Use case and examples based on this could be for instance the definition of Waste Management Plans or the delimitation of areas of special care or susceptibility related to different risk sources (e.g Nuclear radioactivity or chemical emissions).

As source of food for consumption, all these holdings are also subjected to a wide range of sanitary legislation and animal care and management (traceability, animal health, cattle registry,...). (e.g. control of animal diseases, cattle registration of movements, ...)

As activities taking place directly over the environment, extracting and consuming resources from it (land, water) they are also subjected to legislation that control the use of resources and the use of certain kind of substances (Nitrates, Irrigation, Manure, ...).

[.underline]#*Important feature types and attributes:*#

Agricultural and Aquaculture facilities, Holdings, independently of their use, may have an exact and fixed location (point, line, area).

Holding location may exist as coordinates or indirectly through the address, property (cadastral information) or buildings. Use of GIS or web services may join their databases and databases offering possibilities for indirect referencing.

Objects (things or constructions) can be spatially expressed as points or polygons depending on the scale. Lineal facilities can be expressed as networks (arc-node).

Plots must be described as polygons (surfaces).

[.underline]#*Definition:*#

(INSPIRE, 2007) Farming equipment and production facilities (including irrigation systems, greenhouses and stables). [Directive 2007/2/EC]

[.underline]#*Description:*#

The theme "_Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_" concerns the description of all the physical instruments and constructions with permanent or semi-permanent emplacement (inland or outland) that are related to agricultural and aquaculture activities.

Agriculture refers to the set of process and activities consisting in cultivating soils, producing crops and rearing animals; it includes harvesting, milking, breeding animals, keeping animals for farming purposes, and, according to Council Regulation 73/2009, maintaining the land in good agricultural and environmental condition. Agricultural facilities include facilities ranging from entire holdings to installations such as irrigation systems, drainage systems, greenhouses, stables, barns, silos and tanks.

Aquaculture covers activities and techniques related to the production, breeding and treatment of fish, molluscs, seaweed and other kinds of aquatic resources (vegetables or animal). Aquaculture facilities only include permanent or semi-permanent systems or constructions for breeding, treatment and raising of organisms. Aquaculture facilities may exist both in marine waters, inland water environments and as terrestrial production systems.

Catching, hunting or collection of natural resources (vegetables or animal) on their natural environment is not considered as an agricultural activity, unless it is supported by relevant physical instruments and constructions. Similarly, forestry is not considered as an agricultural activity, with the exception of tree nurseries.

=== Terms and definitions

General terms and definitions helpful for understanding the INSPIRE data specification documents are defined in the INSPIRE Glossaryfootnote:[The INSPIRE Glossary is available from http://inspire-registry.jrc.ec.europa.eu/registers/GLOSSARY].

Specifically, for the theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_, the following terms are defined:

*(1) Activity Complex*

It refers to a single unit, both technically and economically, which has a single management and which undertakes classified economic activities

In Agriculture and Aquaculture the Holding class is an extension of Activity Complex.

*(2) Agriculture*

It refers to the set of process and activities consisting in cultivating soils, producing crops and rearing animals; it includes harvesting, milking, breeding animals and keeping animals for farming purposes. According to Council Regulation 73/2009 maintaining the land in good agricultural and environmental condition shall be considered as an agricultural activity.

*(3) Livestock*

Refers to animals being bred and/or raised for use or profit (covered by the activities defined under NACE codes A.1.4. and A.1.5).

*(4) Aquaculture:*

Set of activities and techniques related to the production, breeding and treatment of fish, molluscs, seaweed and other kinds of aquatic resources (vegetables or animal).

Farming systems are diverse:

* Freshwater, brackish water or saltwater environment.
* For on-growing, hatcheries and nurseries.
* In cages, tanks, ponds, enclosures and pens, re-circulation systems, mollusks on bottom, molluscs off bottom.

*(5) Utility*

Object (thing or construction), simple or complex (integrated by parts or pieces), that is useful for a specific use.

*(6) Production*

From the economic point of view production is to create utility, being utility the capacity to generate satisfaction through a product, an economic service or an economic good.

*(7) Installation:*

Set of physical elements, operating in a coordinated manner, that are requested to perform a particular activity.

Installations include:

* Storage and distribution facilities (gas, liquid, solid).
* Power facilities (Generating, distribution and transformation)
* Industrial Machines and Equipment (Industrial and Automated Processes)
* Irrigation Facilities (Storage, Uptake, Distribution, Dispersion).
* Animal confinement (Stables, Cages, Enclosures)
* Sanitary Facilities (Veterinary, Washing, ...)
* Facilities for people and administrative services (Offices, Costumes).
* Crop Acclimatization (Greenhouses, Plastic Structures).
* Transport Facilities (Rural Ways)

Each Installation has a geographical location.

*(8) Plot*

Independent portion of land or water surface (clearly delimited e.g by fences, walls or boundery markers) including (or matching) on the limits of a Site, that is the support for a specific use directly related to the Agricultural or Aquaculture activities performed by the Holding.

*(9) Area*

Portion of territory (Land Use - Urban Planning) in which it is possible to perform a legal implantation of Agricultural or Aquaculture Facilities. It's also a _quantity_ expressing the two-_dimensional_ size of a defined part of a _surface_, typically a region bounded by a closed _curve_.

*(10)* *Facility*

=== How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 1 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).
====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X* This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.
====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X* 

Recommendations are shown using this style.
====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

<<<
== Specification scopes

This data specification does not distinguish different specification scopes, but just considers one general scope.

NOTE For more information on specification scopes, see [ISO 19131:2007], clause 8 and Annex D.

<<<
== Identification information

These Technical Guidelines are identified by the following URI:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/tg/af/3.0

NOTE ISO 19131 suggests further identification information to be included in this section, e.g. the title, abstract or spatial representation type. The proposed items are already described in the document metadata, executive summary, overview description (section 2) and descriptions of the application schemas (section 5). In order to avoid redundancy, they are not repeated here.

<<<
== Data content and structure

=== Application schemas â€“ Overview 

==== Application schema included in the IRs

Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Implementing Rules lay down the requirements for the content and structure of the data sets related to the INSPIRE Annex themes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 4_
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ are defined in the following application schemas (see section 5.3):

* _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities Model_ application schema.

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

==== Additional recommended application schema 

In addition to the application schemas listed above, the following additional application schemas have been defined for the theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ (see section 5.4):

* _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities Extended Model_ application schema.

These additional application schemas are not included in the IRs. They typically address requirements from specific (groups of) use cases and/or may be used to provide additional information. They are included in this specification in order to improve interoperability also for these additional aspects and to illustrate the extensibility of the application schemas included in the IRs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

Additional and/or use case-specific information related to the theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ should be made available using the spatial object types and data types specified in the following application schema(s): _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ Extended Model.

These spatial object types and data types should comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles defined in this section.

The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types should comply with the definitions and include the values defined in this section.

====

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema â€“ across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 5_
*Types*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.
. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 1 below.

[.text-center]
*Table 1 â€“ Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[cols=",,", options="header"]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided â€“ either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 2*

The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the Â«voidableÂ» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the Â«voidableÂ» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=5]
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

. Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:
[loweralpha]
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;
.. code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 3*

Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 4*

Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows.
+
INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>/<value>.


* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined.
+
Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists.
+
The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:
+
** The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.
** The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".
** In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.
** The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones.

+
Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.


[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 5*

The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<UpperCamelCaseName>_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "\{complete,disjoint}".

==== Identifier management

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.
. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

====

NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier which is published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. [DS-D2.5]

NOTE 2 Article 9(1) is implemented in each application schema by including the attribute _inspireId_ of type Identifier.

NOTE 3 Article 9(2) is ensured if the _namespace_ and _localId_ attributes of the Identifier remains the same for different versions of a spatial object; the _version_ attribute can of course change.

==== Geometry representation

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_
*Other Requirements & Rules*

. The value domain of spatial properties defined in this Regulation shall be restricted to the Simple Feature spatial schema as defined in Herring, John R. (ed.), OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information â€“ Simple feature access â€“ Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

[IMPORTANT]

[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 10_
*Life-cycle of Spatial Objects*

(...)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where the attributes beginLifespanVersion and endLifespanVersion are used, the value of endLifespanVersion shall not be before the value of beginLifespanVersion.

====

NOTE The requirement expressed in the IR Requirement above will be included as constraints in the UML data models of all themes.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 6*

If life-cycle information is not maintained as part of the spatial data set, all spatial objects belonging to this data set should provide a void value with a reason of "unpopulated".

====

===== Validity of the real-world phenomena

The application schema(s) use(s) the attributes "validFrom" and "validTo" to record the validity of the real-world phenomenon represented by a spatial object.

The attributes "validFrom" specifies the date and time at which the real-world phenomenon became valid in the real world. The attribute "validTo" specifies the date and time at which the real-world phenomenon is no longer valid in the real world.

Specific application schemas may give examples what "being valid" means for a specific real-world phenomenon represented by a spatial object.

=== Application schema Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities Model

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ model is composed by core information in relation to the geographical description of entities under the Agriculture and Aquaculture scope. It is based on the _Activity Complex_ model (Doc 2.10.3). This Activity Complex model is extended to the basic Agricultural and Aquaculture features Holding and Site. These features contains only basic information about the location of the Holding and the Site, the type of activities performed on that locations, and just in case that animals are kept, what type of animals is kept on the Site.

A Holding is regarded as a specialisation of an Activity Complex. Each Activity Complex - Holding contains at least one or more Sites. On a Site animals can be kept. On a Site, none, one or more animal species can be recorded.

The location of Holding and Site can be expressed as a point or a surface (polygon).

The activity of Holding and Site is expressed by using the standard NACE classification list.

The data type _FarmAnimalSpecies_ is expressed by using a standard code list for livestock animal species and a standard FAO code list for aquaculture species.

* [.underline]#Activity Complex#: The whole area and all infrastructures on it, under the control of an operator. In the AF theme the Activity Complex has the specialised representation named Holding.
* [.underline]#Holding#: The whole area and all infrastructures included on it, under the control of an operator to perform agricultural or aquaculture activities. It may be composed of one or more "Sites".
+
This concept is related to all the common information that applies over all the different entities related to the Agricultural and Aquaculture activity or activities under the responsibility of one legal operator. It could be considered as the synthetic geographical representation of a unique operational, economical or legal body.

* [.underline]#Site#: Belonging to a holding, it is the geographical representation of land that constitutes a management unit. It includes all infrastructure, equipment and materials.
+
The concept of "Site" is related to polygonal areas. Its definition and scope derived from the legal definition of "Site" where the term is described as:
+
_All land at a distinct geographic location under the management control of an operator [Directive 2006/21/EC];_
+
_All land at a distinct geographic location under the management control of an organisation covering activities, products and services. This includes all infrastructure, equipment and materials [REGULATION (EC) 761/2001];_
+
All "Holding" must be related at least to one "Site" but a Holding can manage one or more "Sites".
+
The geographical extension of the "Site" has been described as _GM_Object_ to allow its representation as a point (inherited from holding) or more complex representations as a Set of Isolated Polygons (Multisurface). Topologically all the rest of geographical elements should be included under the limits of one "Site". If necessary a "Site" should be created to include each of these representative sub-elements.

* [.underline]#Farm Animal Species#: It is a Data Type related with "Site" which allows to describe the presence of animals on it.

===== UML Overview

[.text-center]
*Figure 3 â€“ UML class diagram: Overview of the code lists of the Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities Model application schema*

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

The geographical representation of _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ (Holdings specially) must be considered as independent. That means entities described should have their own geographical definition. Although in the majority of cases a direct relation could be established with other geographical elements, this relation could become a source of errors in the accuracy of the geo-position of the elements included on the Datasets. Addresses or Cadastral Parcels information must be managed carefully to avoid overlaps and inconsistencies with information stored in existing Datasets.

Internally, information related to the same "facilities" or elements included on them can exist isolated in different datasets from different institutions or data providers. All this information should be unified in order to avoid duplications or redundancy of information. Other important question is the maintenance of the Topological relationship between entities mainly on those provided by different sources (data providers).

===== Identifier management

The _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ data specification uses the Identifier data type from the INSPIRE General Conceptual Model [DS-D2.5]. These identifiers include version number, so they can be used to track changes to an object.

_Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ are subject to a multitude of identifiers depending on the applicability of the datasets in which are originally included (legal registration, registry based on legislation, ...). Based on this multiplicity it is quite difficult to harmonize a criterion in order to avoid duplicity. For this reason, and based on the applicability of layers to specific use cases the model has included identifiers only at the level of the Activity Complex - Holding.

At the Sites level unique identifiers are not implemented.

===== Modelling of object references

If data providers choose to implement external object references to spatial object types in other themes, they should ensure that update mechanisms are in place in order to ensure consistency among the referenced objects.

===== Geometry representation

In general, the geographical information (datasets) should be provided by different organizations (Private and Public Administration related with _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ referring at least the geographical position of the main "Holdings" as a "points" independently of the level of detail.

Onto the most generic legislation (Waste, IPPC, E-PRTR) the geographical information is required on Geographical coordinates (X,Y). In certain cases the geographical position could be estimated by automatic process through the "Address" provided on the registration forms. This kind of activity can derive on wrong geospatial location as result of the source information provided (e.g. legal address instead of facility address). A clean-up process over datasets should guarantee the accuracy geo-location of entities.

In case of "Holdings" composed by different "Sites" not continuous geographically, it would be valid to provide the geographical information related to the main one. It would not be valid, if lacks between different "Sites" are representative, defining the position as a "_centroid_" of all of them as geo-representation.

If the _GM_Object_ element is applied as _GM_Multisurface_, it involves that all different "Sites" share all the attributes. This has to be considered when Farm Animal Species are described.

In some cases related with agricultural or aquaculture activities which cover a representative extension of land (maritime or terrestrial), "Sites", this could be provided as most detailed geographical representation of the "Holding", described as polygons (2D) in Local â€“ Regional Datasets. Based on this option, the model include and extension for this particular case. In some cases "Sites" or Polygons in which other kind of elements included on the model are placed could be linked with cadastral parcels but this relation seems to be quite complex from the ontological point of view and it has not been considered.

Other kind of potential geo-referenced information is required under the legislation embedded on documents and descriptions requested without references to specific formats. This option only could be resolved with external elements (like URL's) or the inclusion of raster layers (out of the scope).

The model is open to other kind of detailed elements included on the "Holding" (e.g. Installations, Plots, Technical Units). These elements should be represented by geographical entities topologically related with the "Site". In same cases the geographical representation could be coincident and inherited from the higher hierarchical level to which they belong.

=== Application schema Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities Extended Model 

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The Extended Model represents complementary information about _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_. It is based on extensions about plots, agri-buildings, installations, irrigation and drainage, farm animals and animal health.

In the extended model complementary information describes entities and process directly related to the core part entities. Elements of this part of the model can exist independently and geographically (and in the real world) but always included on the Site. There are two different extensions:

* [.underline]#Detailed components#: Related to physical elements that have to be independently described because of their particular function or position (quantitative information).

* [.underline]#Operations#: Alphanumerical information related to variables derived from operational process performed on the Site as part of one activity.


A Holding is regarded as a specialisation of an Activity Complex. Each Activity Complex - Holding contains at least 1 or more Sites. On a Site animals can be kept. On a Site, none, one or more animal species can be recorded.

A Site can contain one or more Plots. Plots are geographical features with detailed information about the activities performed on them, irrigation and drainage.

A Site can contain one or more AgriBuildings. These AgriBuildings can be related to Buildings (a feature defined in the Annex III theme Buildings).

A site can also contain one or more Installations, constructions not being buildings. These Installations can be related to Other Constructions (a feature defined in the Annex III theme Buildings).

In case the Installation is a _waterinstallation_, a water inlet or outlet device, the installation can be connected to the Appurtenance (annex III, US.core water network) or to a HydroObject (Annex I hydrography).

The FarmAnimalSpecies data type contains detailed information about the kind of animals kept on the site, the amount and the health status of that type of animals. The type of FarmAnimalSpecies is expressed by using a standard code list for livestock animal species. For aquaculture a standard FAO code list is used.

The location of Holding and Site can be expressed as a point or a surface (polygon).

The activity of Holding and Site is expressed by using the standard NACE codes.

Dedicated specialized association at the level of Site with Cadastral Parcels is implemented.

* [.underline]#Holding#: The whole area and all infrastructures included on it, under the control of an operator to perform Agricultural or Aquaculture activities. It may be composed of one or more "Sites".
+
This concept is related to all the common information that applies over all the different entities related to the Agricultural and Aquaculture activity or activities under the responsibility of one legal operator. It could be consider as the synthetic geographical representation of a unique operational, economical or legal body.
+
Activity Complex, considered as legal activities that take place over a permanent or semi-permanent portion of the territory, can be linked in several ways with other type of geographical information related on the Annex.I "reference themes".
+
Holding in the extended model include detailed information of the Holding based on the common data types described on Activity Complex general model. This allows to define a set of elements related to the activity as Inputs (understood as consumed material) and Outputs (understood as materials resulting of the activity, including pollutants, waste, final goods, waste water, ...) and legal issues as permissions, and responsible parties and the role these parties have.

* [.underline]#Site#: Belonging to a holding, it is the geographical representation of land that constitutes a management unit. It includes all infrastructure, equipment and materials.
+
The concept of "Site" is related to polygonal areas. Its definition and scope derived from the legal definition of "Site" where the term is described as:
+
_All land at a distinct geographic location under the management control of an operator [Directive 2006/21/EC];_
+
_All land at a distinct geographic location under the management control of an organisation covering activities, products and services. This includes all infrastructure, equipment and materials [REGULATION (EC) 761/2001];_
+
All "Holding" must be related at least to one "Site" (multiplicity [1..*]) but a Holding can manage one or more "Sites". Relations must be done as constrained among both extended classes Site-Holding.
+
The geographical extension of the "Site" has been described as _GM_Object_ to allow its representation as a point (inherited from holding) or more complex representations as a Set of Isolated Polygons (Multisurface). Topologically all the rest of geographical elements should be included under the limits of one "Site". If necessary a "Site" should be created to include each of these representative sub-elements.
+
Extended Site includes Identifier and information about the permissions based on the common data types described on Activity Complex general model.

* [.underline]#Installation#: It refers to all technical instruments and constructions included on the "Site" that should be described independently. It allows referring to specific sub-elements included on the "Site" and legally related to the "Holding".

* [.underline]#Plot#: This entity allows describing in a abstract sense delimited portions of land or water (independently of their size or delimitation method) included on a "Site" dedicated to a specific function as part of a major activity and geographically identifiable. "Plot" concept shouldn't be confused with Cadastral entities despite in some cases it could be coincident on the real world with them.


* [.underline]#AgriBuilding#: The relation between "Buildings" and specific uses is quite fuzzy, for this reason, only buildings dedicated to specific functions related to the Activity should be linked with the Agricultural and Aquaculture model, otherwise the consistency of datasets could be quite complicated.

* [.underline]#AgriBuilding#: The relation between "Buildings" and specific uses is quite fuzzy, for this reason, only buildings dedicated to specific functions related to the Activity should be linked with the Agricultural and Aquaculture model, otherwise the consistency of datasets could be quite complicated.

* [.underline]#HydroObject#: The relation between "HydroObject" and "Installation" illustrates the link between the hydrographic system (irrigation and drainage systems) of the Site and the natural hydro objects, like ponds, lakes, rivers and canals, which are identified by annex1 theme Hydrography.

== Reference systems, units of measure and grids

=== Default reference systems, units of measure and grid

The reference systems, units of measure and geographic grid systems included in this sub-section are the defaults to be used for all INSPIRE data sets, unless theme-specific exceptions and/or additional requirements are defined in section 6.2.

==== Coordinate reference systems

===== Datum

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.2_
*Datum for three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems*

For the three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems and the horizontal component of compound coordinate reference systems used for making spatial data sets available, the datum shall be the datum of the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) in areas within its geographical scope, or the datum of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) or other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with ITRS in areas that are outside the geographical scope of ETRS89. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of the ITRS and there is a well documented relationship between both systems, according to EN ISO 19111.

====

===== Coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.3_
*Coordinate Reference Systems*

Spatial data sets shall be made available using at least one of the coordinate reference systems specified in sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, unless one of the conditions specified in section 1.3.4 holds.

*IR Requirement*
_Article 11_
*Temporal Reference Systems*

. The default temporal reference system referred to in point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (footnote:[OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12.]) shall be used, unless other temporal reference systems are specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE 1 Point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (the INSPIRE Metadata IRs) states that the default reference system shall be the Gregorian calendar, with dates expressed in accordance with ISO 8601.

NOTE 2 ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats â€“ Information interchange â€“ Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. The standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears first in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It also provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information across time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

EXAMPLE 1997 (the year 1997), 1997-07-16 (16^th^ July 1997), 1997-07-16T19:20:3001:00 (16^th^ July 1997, 19h 20' 30'', time zone: UTC1)

== Data quality

This chapter includes a description of the data quality elements and sub-elements as well as the corresponding data quality measures that should be used to evaluate and document data quality for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ (section 7.1).

It may also define requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ (sections 7.2 and 7.3).

In particular, the data quality elements, sub-elements and measures specified in section 7.1 should be used for

* evaluating and documenting data quality properties and constraints of spatial objects, where such properties or constraints are defined as part of the application schema(s) (see section 5);

* evaluating and documenting data quality metadata elements of spatial data sets (see section 8); and/or

* specifying requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ (see sections 7.2 and 7.3).


The descriptions of the elements and measures are based on Annex D of ISO/DIS 19157 Geographic information â€“ Data quality.

=== Data quality elements

Table 3 lists all data quality elements and sub-elements that are being used in this specification. Data quality information can be evaluated at level of spatial object, spatial object type, dataset or dataset series. The level at which the evaluation is performed is given in the "Evaluation Scope" column.

The measures to be used for each of the listed data quality sub-elements are defined in the following sub-sections.

The mean positional uncertainties of the horizontal absolute or external
positions are then calculated as

image::./media/image12.png[image,width=119,height=82, align=center]

A criterion for the establishing of correspondence should also be stated (e.g.
allowing for correspondence to the closest position, correspondence on
vertices or along lines). The criterion/criteria for finding the corresponding
points shall be reported with the data quality evaluation result.
This data quality measure is different from the standard deviation.

== Dataset-level metadata

This section specifies dataset-level metadata elements, which should be used for documenting metadata for a complete dataset or dataset series.

NOTE Metadata can also be reported for each individual spatial object (spatial object-level metadata). Spatial object-level metadata is fully described in the application schema(s) (section 5).

For some dataset-level metadata elements, in particular those for reporting data quality and maintenance, a more specific scope can be specified. This allows the definition of metadata at sub-dataset level, e.g. separately for each spatial object type (see instructions for the relevant metadata element).

=== Metadata elements defined in INSPIRE Metadata Regulation

Table 4 gives an overview of the metadata elements specified in Regulation 1205/2008/EC (implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata).

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to the relevant section in the Metadata Regulation, which contains a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.
* The fourth column specifies the condition, under which the given element becomes mandatory.

Generic guidelines for implementing these elements using ISO 19115 and 19119 are available at _http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101_. The following sections describe additional theme-specific recommendations and requirements for implementing these elements.

==== Conformity

The _Conformity_ metadata element defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC requires to report the conformance with the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services. In addition, it may be used also to document the conformance to another specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 14*

Dataset metadata should include a statement on the overall conformance of the dataset with this data specification (i.e. conformance with all requirements).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 15*

The _Conformity_ metadata element should be used to document conformance with this data specification (as a whole), with a specific conformance class defined in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A and/or with another specification.

====

The _Conformity_ element includes two sub-elements, the _Specification_ (a citation of the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services or other specification), and the _Degree_ of conformity. The _Degree_ can be _Conformant_ (if the dataset is fully conformant with the cited specification), _Not Conformant_ (if the dataset does not conform to the cited specification) or _Not Evaluated_ (if the conformance has not been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 16*

If a dataset is not yet conformant with all requirements of this data specification, it is recommended to include information on the conformance with the individual conformance classes specified in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 17*

If a dataset is produced or transformed according to an external specification that includes specific quality assurance procedures, the conformity with this specification should be documented using the _Conformity_ metadata element.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 18*

If minimum data quality recommendations are defined then the statement on the conformity with these requirements should be included using the _Conformity_ metadata element and referring to the relevant data quality conformance class in the Abstract Test Suite.

====

NOTE Currently no minimum data quality requirements are included in the IRs. The recommendation above should be included as a requirement in the IRs if minimum data quality requirements are defined at some point in the future.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 19*

When documenting conformance with this data specification or one of the conformance classes defined in the Abstract Test Suite, the _Specification_ sub-element should be given using the http URI identifier of the conformance class or using a citation including the following elements:

* title: "INSPIRE Data Specification on _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ â€“ Draft Guidelines â€“ <name of the conformance class>"
* date:
** dateType: publication
** date: 2013-12-10

==== Lineage

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 20*

Following the ISO/DIS 19157 Quality principles, if a data provider has a procedure for the quality management of their spatial data sets then the appropriate data quality elements and measures defined in ISO/DIS 19157 should be used to evaluate and report (in the metadata) the results. If not, the _Lineage_ metadata element (defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC) should be used to describe the overall quality of a spatial data set.

====

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, lineage "is a statement on process history and/or overall quality of the spatial data set. Where appropriate it may include a statement whether the data set has been validated or quality assured, whether it is the official version (if multiple versions exist), and whether it has legal validity. The value domain of this metadata element is free text".

The Metadata Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119 specifies that the statement sub-element of LI_Lineage (EN ISO 19115) should be used to implement the lineage metadata element.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 21*

To describe the transformation steps and related source data, it is recommended to use the following sub-elements of LI_Lineage:

* For the description of the transformation process of the local to the common INSPIRE data structures, the LI_ProcessStep sub-element should be used.

* For the description of the source data the LI_Source sub-element should be used.

====

NOTE 1 In order to improve the interoperability, domain templates and instructions for using these free text elements (descriptive statements) may be specified here and/or in an Annex of this data specification.

==== Temporal reference

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, at least one of the following temporal reference metadata sub-elements shall be provided: temporal extent, date of publication, date of last revision, date of creation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 22*

It is recommended that at least the date of the last revision of a spatial data set should be reported using the _Date of last revision_ metadata sub-element.

====

=== Metadata elements for interoperability

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 13_
*Metadata required for Interoperability*

The metadata describing a spatial data set shall include the following metadata elements required for interoperability:

. Coordinate Reference System: Description of the coordinate reference system(s) used in the data set.

. Temporal Reference System: Description of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.

. Encoding: Description of the computer language construct(s) specifying the representation of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device or transmission channel.

. Topological Consistency: Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the data set as described by the scope.
+
This element is mandatory only if the data set includes types from the Generic Network Model and does not assure centreline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for the network.

. Character Encoding: The character encoding used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if an encoding is used that is not based on UTF-8.

. Spatial Representation Type: The method used to spatially represent geographic information.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to implement the required metadata elements based on ISO 19115 and ISO/TS 19139.

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with the proposed encoding.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 2*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the used ISO 19139 XML schema.

====

NOTE Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 3*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall contain the elements and meet the INSPIRE multiplicity specified in the sections below.

====

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 4*

The elements specified below shall be available in the specified ISO/TS 19139 path.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 23*

The metadata elements for interoperability should be made available together with the metadata elements defined in the Metadata Regulation through an INSPIRE discovery service.

====

NOTE While this not explicitly required by any of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, making all metadata of a data set available together and through one service simplifies implementation and usability.

==== Metadata elements for reporting data quality

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 26*

For reporting the results of the data quality evaluation, the data quality elements, sub-elements and (for quantitative evaluation) measures defined in chapter 7 should be used.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 27*

The metadata elements specified in the following sections should be used to report the results of the data quality evaluation. At least the information included in the row "Implementation instructions" should be provided.

====

The first section applies to reporting quantitative results (using the element DQ_QuantitativeResult), while the second section applies to reporting non-quantitative results (using the element DQ_DescriptiveResult).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 28*

If a dataset does not pass the tests of the Application schema conformance class (defined in Annex A), the results of each test should be reported using one of the options described in sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2.

====

NOTE 1 If using non-quantitative description, the results of several tests do not have to be reported separately, but may be combined into one descriptive statement.

NOTE 2 The sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2 may need to be updated once the XML schemas for ISO 19157 have been finalised.

The scope for reporting may be different from the scope for evaluating data quality (see section 7). If data quality is reported at the data set or spatial object type level, the results are usually derived or aggregated.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 29*

The scope element (of type DQ_Scope) of the DQ_DataQuality subtype should be used to encode the reporting scope.

Only the following values should be used for the level element of DQ_Scope: Series, Dataset, featureType.

If the level is featureType the levelDescription/MDScopeDescription/features element (of type Set< GF_FeatureType>) shall be used to list the feature type names.

====

NOTE In the level element of DQ_Scope, the value featureType is used to denote spatial object type.

== Delivery

=== Updates

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 8_
*Updates*

. Member States shall make available updates of data on a regular basis.

. All updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set, unless a different period is specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE In this data specification, no exception is specified, so all updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set.

=== Delivery medium

According to Article 11(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for INSPIRE spatial data sets and services. The relevant network service types for making spatial data available are:

* _view services_ making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;
* _download services_, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;
* _transformation services_, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability.

NOTE For the relevant requirements and recommendations for network services, see the relevant Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelinesfootnote:[The Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines on INSPIRE Network Services are available at http://inspire.jrc.ec].

EXAMPLE 1 Through the Get Spatial Objects function, a download service can either download a pre-defined data set or pre-defined part of a data set (non-direct access download service), or give direct access to the spatial objects contained in the data set, and download selections of spatial objects based upon a query (direct access download service). To execute such a request, some of the following information might be required:

* the list of spatial object types and/or predefined data sets that are offered by the download service (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation),
* and the query capabilities section advertising the types of predicates that may be used to form a query expression (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation, where applicable),
* a description of spatial object types offered by a download service instance (to be provided through the Describe Spatial Object Types operation).

EXAMPLE 2 Through the Transform function, a transformation service carries out data content transformations from native data forms to the INSPIRE-compliant form and vice versa. If this operation is directly called by an application to transform source data (e.g. obtained through a download service) that is not yet conformant with this data specification, the following parameters are required:

Input data (mandatory). The data set to be transformed.

* Source model (mandatory, if cannot be determined from the input data). The model in which the input data is provided.
* Target model (mandatory). The model in which the results are expected.
* Model mapping (mandatory, unless a default exists). Detailed description of how the transformation is to be carried out.

=== Encodings

The IRs contain the following two requirements for the encoding to be used to make data available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 7_
*Encoding*

{empty}1. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall conform to EN ISO 19118. In particular, it shall specify schema conversion rules for all spatial object types and all attributes and association roles and the output data structure used.

{empty}2. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall be made available.

{empty}2a. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall also specify whether and how to represent attributes and association roles for which a corresponding value exists but is not contained in the spatial data sets maintained by a Member State, or cannot be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.


====

NOTE ISO 19118:2011 specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules used for interchange of geographic data within the set of International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". An encoding rule allows geographic information defined by application schemas and standardized schemas to be coded into a system-independent data structure suitable for transport and storage. The encoding rule specifies the types of data being coded and the syntax, structure and coding schemes used in the resulting data structure. Specifically, ISO 19118:2011 includes

* requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas,
* requirements for creating encoding services, and
* requirements for XML-based encoding rules for neutral interchange of data.

While the IRs do not oblige the usage of a specific encoding, these Technical Guidelines propose to make data related to the spatial data theme _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ available at least in the default encoding(s) specified in section 9.3.1. In this section, a number of TG requirements are listed that need to be met in order to be conformant with the default encoding(s).

The proposed default encoding(s) meet the requirements in Article 7 of the IRs, i.e. they are conformant with ISO 19118 and (since they are included in this specification) publicly available.

==== Default Encoding(s)

===== Specific requirements for GML encoding

This data specification proposes the use of GML as the default encoding, as recommended in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of [DS-D2.7]. GML is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118, as required in Article 7(1). For details, see [ISO 19136], and in particular Annex E (UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules).

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with GML encodings.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 5*

Data instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the provided XML schema.

====

NOTE 1 Not all constraints defined in the application schemas can be mapped to XML. Therefore, the following requirement is necessary.

NOTE 2 The obligation to use only the allowed code list values specified for attributes and most of the constraints defined in the application schemas cannot be mapped to the XML sch. They can therefore not be enforced through schema validation. It may be possible to express some of these constraints using other schema or rule languages (e.g. Schematron), in order to enable automatic validation.

===== Default encoding(s) for application schema Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities Model

<<<
== Data Capture

Facilities may be considered under INSPIRE scope if they meet with the following criteria:

* Information related with the Activities performed on them shall be provided for the use or the benefit of the public excluding strategic or private information not required by law. It can be used by other administrations or private companies as well.
* Based on the INSPIRE principles, the service can be used for environmental issues.
* Also, in order to full fill the requirements of the INSPIRE Directive, the information must be available as Digital Data.

Facilities related data, due to their nature and the wide scope covered, may be captured and served by different data providers at different levels of (mainly) the Public Administration. Due to this fact, it is expected that data will be stored at very different formats, scales and resolutions, covering different sub-sets of data, service types and different modeling approaches, depending on the concrete needs of their correspondent producers and target users.

The Geographical entities covered by the scope of Facilities cover a wide range of profiles and scales. In higher levels of the scale, geographical position is derived from tabular data, gazzeters or manual processing mostly based on Geographical Coordinates. Different Data Sets can follow parallel geo-reference processes to geo-locate same real world entities. In some cases there is no authomatic interconnection through identifiers to establish the connection among datasets which can difficult the merging process or generate duplications or overlaps.

VAT (or fiscal codes) should not be assigned directly to a facility, as the VAT code identifies a legal entity, rather than a spatial entity and it is subject to temporal variations.

*Figure 8 â€“ Range of Scopes covered under "Facilities"*

It cannot be expected that a single set of requirements may be established in order to harmonize these theme's data sets. In consequence, just the following recommendations are proposed:

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 30*

Given that it is not expected that all of the available datasets are captured, produced and publicized by a single level of Public Administration Bodies and that it may happen that these bodies may be responsible for just one or several sub-sets of data, not necessarily categorizing the Activities following the NACE Code List, data should be transformed in such a way that at least the main class of the model (linked with Activity Complex) should be categorized by at least one of the Activities listed within the NACE Code List.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 31*

If the current thematic Legislative Act fix certain parameters for accuracy in the Geographical location of the entities (Geographical Coordinates), these should be considered as the minimum level of accuracy under INSPIRE (e.g. _Location of the Holding_ under REGULATION (EC) No 1166/2008)

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 32*

In order to fill the previous recommendation, datasets should be built by setting different layers for each of the main Activities covered (higher level of categorization following the NACE List).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 33*

In order to minimize the risk of geometrical and positional incoherence between different datasets Economical Activities, when data about an instance is located by means of GM_Object, it is recommended to choose GM_Point as default.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 34*

When data about an instance of Economical Activities is located by means of a point or an address geo-location, this should correspond to the main access point to the space where the service is provided from. Only contrasted geo-located locations against the reality should be provided in order to avoid errors and misunderstandings.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 35*

Sets the requirement that point representation areas always must be inside the contour of the real world entity that is describing.

== Portrayal

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for this theme. Portrayal is regulated in Article 14 of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

. For the portrayal of spatial data sets using a view network service as specified in Commission Regulation No 976/2009 (footnote:[.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/5]), the following shall be available:
[loweralpha]
.. the layers specified in Annex II for the theme or themes the data set is related to;
.. for each layer at least a default portrayal style, with as a minimum an associated title and a unique identifier.

[arabic, start=2]
. For each layer, Annex II defines the following:
[loweralpha]
.. a human readable title of the layer to be used for display in user interface;
.. the spatial object type(s), or sub-set thereof, that constitute(s) the content of the layer.

====

In section ï‚·, the _types_ of layers are defined that are to be used for the portrayal of the spatial object types defined in this specification. A view service may offer several layers of the same type, one for each dataset that it offers data on a specific topic.

NOTE The layer specification in the IRs only contains the name, a human readable title and the (subset(s) of) spatial object type(s), that constitute(s) the content of the layer. In addition, these Technical Guidelines suggest keywords for describing the layer.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 36*

It is recommended to use the keywords specified in section ï‚· in the _Layers Metadata parameters_ of the INSPIRE View service (see Annex III, Part A, section 2.2.4 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009).

====

Section 0 specifies one style for each of these layers. It is proposed that INSPIRE view services support this style as the default style required by Article 14(1b).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 6*

For each layer specified in this section, the styles defined in section 0 shall be available.

====

NOTE The default style should be used for portrayal by the view network service if no user-defined style is specified in a portrayal request for a specific layer.

In section 11.3, further styles can be specified that represent examples of styles typically used in a thematic domain. It is recommended that also these styles should be supported by INSPIRE view services, where applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 37*

In addition, it is recommended that, where applicable, INSPIRE view services also support the styles defined in section 11.3.

====

Where XML fragments are used in the following sections, the following namespace prefixes apply:

* sld="http://www.opengis.net/sld"Â (WMS/SLD 1.1)
* se="http://www.opengis.net/se"Â (SE 1.1)
* ogc="http://www.opengis.net/ogc"Â (FE 1.1)

=== Layers to be provided by INSPIRE view services

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for the _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ theme.

The _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ theme is represented with four different type map layers:

* Holding: The geographical representation of entities inside which Agricultural and Aquaculture activities are carried out.
* Sites: All land at a distinct geographic location under the management control of Holding covering activities, products and services. This includes all infrastructure, equipment and materials;
* Abstract Installations: Natural or engineered units or apparatus performing activities which have a technical connection with the activities carried out on that site and which could have an effect on emissions and pollution;

* Plots: Independent portion of the land or water surface, clearly delimited, including or matching the limits of the Sites described for a Holding.

[cols=",,,"]

[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

(...)

[arabic, start=3]
. For spatial object types whose objects can be further classified using a code list-valued attribute, several layers may be defined. Each of these layers shall include the spatial objects corresponding to one specific code list value. In the definition of such sets of layers in Annexes II-IV,
[loweralpha]
.. the placeholder <CodeListValue> shall represent the values of the relevant code list, with the first letter in upper case,
.. the placeholder <human-readable name> shall represent the human-readable name of the code list values;
.. the spatial object type shall include the relevant attribute and code list, in parentheses;
.. one example of a layer shall be given.

====

==== Layers organisation

The next hierarchy is recommended to be implemented:

*Concerning Holdings:* Two types of map layers namely _Agricultural Holdings_ and Aquaculture Holding, one for each based on the NACE activity sub-group (Section A - Second Level).

* A - Agriculture, forestry and fishing
** *A1 -* [.underline]#Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities#
*** A1.1 - Growing of non-perennial crops
*** A1.2 - Growing of perennial crops
*** A1.3 - Plant propagation
*** A1.4 - Animal production
*** A1.5 - Mixed farming
*** A1.6 - Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities
*** A1.7 - Hunting, trapping and related service activities
** *A2 -* [.underline]#Forestry and logging (*_A2 -_* _Forestry and logging_ not requiered)#
** *A3 -* [.underline]#Fishing and aquaculture#
*** A3.1 - Fishing
*** A3.2 - Aquaculture

This classification allows distinguish among Agricultural (A-A1) and Aquaculture (A-A3). In a more advanced steps there could be also another level of detail (third level of detail on the NACE hierarchy).

Portrayal is not defined because currently there is not an agreement in the communities about it.

*Concerning Sites:* Only one type layer. Effectively it could be other map layers based on subset as result of the "Activity classification" applied or derived from the Holding to which are linked.

*Concerning Installations:* Only one type layer. Effectively it could be other map layers based on subset as result of the extension of Installation (Irrigation, Water Management, Aquaculture).

*Concerning Plots:* Only one type layer.

*Concerning Agri-Building:* Only one type layer.

== Abstract Test Suite - (normative)

[cols=""]
|===
*Disclaimer*

While this Annex refers to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services, it does not replace the legal act or any part of it.
|===

The objective of the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) included in this Annex is to help the conformance testing process. It includes a set of tests to be applied on a data set to evaluate whether it fulfils the requirements included in this data specification and the corresponding parts of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010 (implementing rule as regards interoperability of spatial datasets and services, further referred to as ISDSS Regulation). This is to help data providers in declaring the conformity of a data set to the "degree of conformity, with implementing rules adopted under Article 7(1) of Directive 2007/2/EC", which is required to be provided in the data set metadata according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2008/1205 (the Metadata Regulation).

*Part 1* of this ATS includes tests that provide *input for assessing conformity with the ISDSS regulation.* In order to make visible which requirements are addressed by a specific test, references to the corresponding articles of the legal act are given. The way how the cited requirements apply to AF specification is described under the testing method.

In addition to the requirements included in ISDSS Regulation this Technical guideline contains TG requirements too. TG requirements are technical provisions that need to be fulfilled in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement when the specific technical implementation proposed in this document is used. Such requirements relate for example to the default encoding described in section 9. *Part 2* of the ATS presents tests necessary for assessing the *conformity with TG requirements*.

NOTE Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in this ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

The *ATS is applicable to the data sets that* *have been transformed* to be made available through INSPIRE download services (i.e. the data returned as a response to the mandatory "Get Spatial Dataset" operation) rather than the original "source" data sets.

The requirements to be tested are grouped in several _conformance classes_. Each of these classes covers a specific aspect: one conformance class contains tests reflecting the requirements on the application schema, another on the reference systems, etc. *Each conformance class is identified by a URI* (uniform resource identifier) according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/AF/<conformance class identifier>

EXAMPLE 1 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ef/rs_ identifies the Reference Systems ISDSS conformance class of the Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF) data theme.

The results of the tests should be published referring to the relevant conformance class (using its URI).

When an INSPIRE data specification contains *more than one application schema,* the requirements tested in a conformance class may differ depending on the application schema used as a target for the transformation of the data set. This will always be the case for the application schema conformance class. However, also other conformance classes could have different requirements for different application schemas. In such cases, a separate conformance class is defined for each application schema, and they are distinguished by specific URIs according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/AF/<conformance class identifier>/ 
<application schema namespace prefix>

EXAMPLE 2 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/el/as/el-vec_ identifies the conformity with the application schema (_as_) conformance class for the Elevation Vector Elements (_el-vec_) application schema.

An overview of the conformance classes and the associated tests is given in the table below.

In order to be conformant to a conformance class, a data set has to pass *all* tests defined for that conformance class.

In order to be conformant with the ISDSS regulation the inspected data set needs to be conformant to *all* conformance classes in Part 1. The conformance class for overall conformity with the ISDSS regulation is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/AF/._

In order to be conformant with the Technical Guidelines, the dataset under inspection needs to be conformant to all conformance classes included both in Part 1 and 2. Chapter 8 describes in detail how to publish the result of testing regarding overall conformity and conformity with the conformance classes as metadata. The conformance class for overall conformity with the Technical Guidelines is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/tg/AF/x.y.(z)._

It should be noted that data providers are not obliged to integrate / decompose the original structure of the source data sets when they deliver them for INSPIRE. It means that a conformant dataset can contain less or more spatial object / data types than specified in the ISDSS Regulation.

*A dataset that contains less spatial object and/or data types* can be regarded conformant when the corresponding types of the source datasets after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation.

A *dataset that contain more spatial object and/or data types* may be regarded as conformant when

* all the spatial object / data types that have corresponding types in the source dataset after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation and
* all additional elements of the source model (spatial object types, data types, attributes, constraints, code lists and enumerations together with their values) do not conflict with any rule defined in the interoperability target specifications defined for any theme within INSPIRE.

The ATS contains a detailed list of abstract tests. It should be noted that some tests in the Application schema conformance class can be automated by utilising xml *schema validation tools.* It should be noted that failing such validation test does not necessary reflect non-compliance to the application schema; it may be the results of erroneous encoding.

Each test in this suit follows the same structure:

* Requirement: citation from the legal texts (ISDSS requirements) or the Technical Guidelines (TG requirements);
* Purpose: definition of the scope of the test;
* Reference: link to any material that may be useful during the test;
* Test method: description of the testing procedure.

According to ISO 19105:2000 all tests in this ATS are basic tests. Therefore, this statement is not repeated each time.

[appendix]
== Use cases - (informative) 
 
As mentioned in Annex E of the ""Data Specifications" Methodology for the development of data specifications", the TWG-AF identified several use cases that are hereunder referenced.

=== Use case: "Safe Plant and Animal Production"

==== Introduction

A safe agricultural production, of both plant production and animal production is a basic requirement for a safe human food supply in the EU and the Members States., Also the export of agricultural products relies on a safe production and the absence of pest, diseases and contamination of these commodities.

The control and the measurements in case of an outbreak of an infectious animal disease, or pests in plant production is regulated by several EU regulations and national implementations.

In case of an accident which caused air, water or soil pollution, in the contaminated area or the potential contaminated area measurements will be taken to prevent contaminated products to be used for human food, animal feed or other products which can have risks for human health.

E.g Fukushima nuclear incident.

Fuhushima nuclear plant and information related (based on Inspire requirements) would be under the PF TWG. AF should provide information to evaluate the impact on agricultural production (food).

* Farms affected by different levels of radiation.
* Traceability of agricultural products. Trucking.
+
A delegation from Japan will visit JRC and one of the experts will try to recover information from them about the analysis and cartographical information they are dealing with. Even about the lacks of information they fount.
+
"Agricultural monitoring and possible interventions surrounding the site" was one of the conclusions proposed after the accident.
+
Information about Agricultural Facilities could be classified by different levels of detail and urgency:
+
** Identify which Agricultural/Aquaculture facilities are inside the different level of radiation (e.g buffers or dispersion model plume).
** Classify with kind of activities are taking place in order to classify actions and responses to be taken.
** Each item produce depending on its nature has different levels of restriction.
** Radiation can vary from air to soil and the persistence of each different medium is different. E.g Water sources can influence on the restrictions.
** Other kind of information (not confirmed if databases about exists already) could be relevant to define areas of indirect influence. (e.g straw or manure commercialized for other purposes by farms that are under the restriction area). Probably waste legislation or the water framework directive could be requesting information related with this purposes.
** About the difference between Site and Holding, is relevant to have access to the distribution of plots (sites) under the control of certain Holdings or companies in order to avoid mixture of material from contaminated areas with other free of radiation effects.

During a crisis process there are different actions on time. Since minute "0" to "years later" period. Each different period require different information. Each step could define new sources and formats from which information is required.

* Alarm system.
* Restrictions.
* Historical Control.

In all these cases it is important to have geographical information available about the agricultural and aquaculture production facilities and production, to support the decisions about the measurements to be taken by the authorities.

In the present situation the geographical information about facilities and production is available but it is divided over many separate databases. In the databases the geographical content is heterogeneous.

To perform a spatial analysis of the treath or the impact of an incident, information of different sources has to be combined. A harmonized geo component and basic information about elements like holdings, sites and installations, buildings and plots is required.

For monitoring various pest and diseases the EU uses model. The quality of the model results can be improved when harmonized detailed information about facilities is made available to these models.nnModels are also used to predict the distribution of infectious deseases and the severity of the outbreak.

Some examples:

Animal diseases:
The outbreak of aviar influenza, classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease and Bluetongue

Plant pests:
Bacterial wilt (potatoes), plant seeds infection with harmfull insects and / or virusses

Incidents:
Contamination with PCBs, metals, dioxine due to a fire incident (zone with air deposition or hydrostructures infected by firefighting water )
Nuclear Contamination
Contamination of water infrastructure due to industrial failure or failure of networks
(watstewaterinstallation and -network failure, industrial proces failure, emergency emission)

Structural:
Continuous contamination due to emissions into air, surface or groundwater from (previous) production facilities (mining, industry)

_(*) It depends on the type of incident._

The data about the emission sources (amounts and categorization) as the geographical location of physical sources could be collected from others or the same dataset.

Also information to evaluate, make calculations or define areas of restriction or under control could be obtained from different thematic areas (INSPIRE themes) or other sources.

AF facilities provide information to define those _Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities_ that are affected or included under the delimited areas, helping to categorize them against the impact received and the actions to be taken as result of the events.

Information can be also applied to define temporal control and monitoring of those facilities affected.

|Step 3 a|

*Monitor and evaluate:*

The relevant AF datasets will be made available to the responsible authorities who need to support their decisions over information (basically geographical).

The problems and measurements to be taken after the event are no part of the use case but a tool to do it.

They are covered by the veterinarian expert, plant health experts, or any other responsible authority, by example the National Food Authority.

Based on inputs from experts and the analysis and monitoring operations as result of previous steps, information could evolve in different ways to more restrictions and actions or to next steps as the closure of the event.

=== Use case: "Animal Diseases in Aquaculture"

==== Introduction

In order to contain and control the spread of animal diseases veterinary authorities rely to a system of registration of holdings and traceability of animal movements established for the major farmed species.

In case of an outbreak of a listed disease, veterinary authorities take a series of measures prescribed by the EU legislation to control spread of the disease. These measures are normally applied to a defined geographical area around the outbreak site and to all farms falling within this area. The availability of spatial information for the delineation of the area subjected to restriction measures and for the identification of affected farms is of great importance for the planning, management and reporting of the control measures prescribed by EU legislation.

The use case considered as example in this document is related to Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) which is an important infectious viral disease affecting Atlantic Salmon.

The disease was first reported in Norway in 1984, and has since been reported in Canada, Faroe Islands, the USA, Ireland and Scotland. The annual cost of infectious salmon anemia outbreaks among farmed fish was estimated to be $11million (U.S. dollars) in Norway in 1999, $14 million in Canada, and $32 million in Scotland in 1998 â€“ 1999. Recent outbreaks were reported in Shetland (Scotland) in 2008-2009.

==== Description

In order to deal with outbreaks of Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA) the Central Veterinary Administration establishes containment areas subjected to movement restriction measures at a certain radius from an affected farm.

An ordinance is issued establishing that in these areas movement restrictions measures on persons, aquatic animals, equipment and means of transport are applied.

Local veterinary authorities control the implementation of these restriction measures.

Relevant stakeholders of the aquaculture industry and the public are informed about the application of these measures.

The following map shows an example of areas with active movement restriction measures in the Western Isles following various outbreaks of disease in fish and shellfish farms.

*Part 1: UML use case diagram*

image::./media/image25.png[image,width=585,height=547, align=center]

*Part 2: Legislative Background*

In the case of aquaculture Council Directive 2006/88/EC prescribes the following measure to be taken in case of suspicion of outbreak of a listed disease:

* farms or molluscs production areas are placed under official surveillance,
* movement to and from the affected farm or area are not allowed and,
* epizootic investigation are initiated.

After the epidemiological investigation if the outbreak of the disease is confirmed:

* the farm or mollusc farming area is declared infected,
* a containment area including protection zone and surveillance zone is established and,
* according to the type of disease a series of control measures including movements' restrictions, compulsory slaughter and disinfection of infected farms are implemented to reduce and prevent the spread of the disease.

In order to allow the identification of aquaculture facilities the Directive 2006/88/EC prescribes that the competent authorities should keep registers of authorized aquaculture production businesses. For each aquaculture production business the register should contain in addition to address and contact details, information on the production type, health status and the geographical position of the farm. In addition, Commission Decision 2008/392/EC, in order to facilitate the interoperability of information between Member States, prescribes that national registers of aquaculture production businesses should be made available through an internet-based information page.

In relation to ISA, Commission Decision 2003/466/EC prescribes that control zones should be drawn in a circle with a radius at least 5 km or of at least one tidal excursion, centered on the infected farm and surveillance zones or an equivalent area determined according to appropriate hydrodynamic or epidemiological data.

Definitions used in the legislation:

'production area' (*) means any freshwater, sea, estuarine, continental or lagoon area containing natural beds of molluscs or sites used for the cultivation of molluscs, and from which molluscs are taken;

'farm' means any premises, enclosed area, or installation operated by an aquaculture production business (AF holding) in which aquaculture animals are reared with a view to their being placed on the market, with the exception of those where wild aquatic animals harvested or caught for the purpose of human consumption are temporarily kept awaiting slaughter without being fed; It would be related with the Site as is described on the AF Data Model.

'epidemiological unit' (*) means a group of aquatic animals that share approximately the same risk of exposure to a disease agent within a defined location. This risk may be because they share a common aquatic environment, or because management practices make it likely that a disease agent in one group of animals would quickly spread to another group of animals;

'containment area' means an area around an infected farm or mollusc farming area where disease control measures are applied with the purpose of preventing the spread of the disease;

'zone' means a precise geographical area (*) with a homogeneous hydrological system comprising part of a water catchment area from the source(s) to a natural or artificial barrier that prevents the upward migration of aquatic animals from lower stretches of the water catchment area, an entire water catchment area from its source(s) to its estuary, or more than one water catchment area, including their estuaries, due to the epidemiological link between the catchment areas through the estuary.

*(*) AF Model doesn't refer to "areas" but includes all the information related at a Holding - Site level.*

=== Use case: "Official controls in mollusk production areas"

==== Introduction

The production of molluscs is subject official controls to ensure food safety and prevent contamination from water pollution and from the accumulation of toxins linked to Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB).

The use of spatial information is needed for the classification of production areas, for the planning of controls, for the monitoring and implementation of the controls and for the communication to producers and other interested parties of the results of the controls and of possible restriction measures.

==== Description

The CA has to fix the location, boundaries and classification of the mollusc production areas.

In order to classify an area the CA:

* makes an inventory of the sources of pollution of human or animal origin likely to be a source of contamination for the production area;
* examines the quantities of organic pollutants which are released during the different periods of the year, according to the seasonal variations of both human and animal populations in the catchment area, rainfall readings, waste water treatment, etc.;
* determines the characteristics of the circulation of pollutants by virtue of current patterns, bathymetry and the tidal cycle in the production area.

Similar sets of spatial information are used on yearly basis to evaluate the risk of contamination for existing mollusc farms and to determine the sampling frequencies and sampling sites.

The CA monitors the implementation of the programme to take appropriate decisions on the production area if the results of the analysis are negative.

To inform producers about the results of the monitoring programme the CA regularly publishes maps and information showing for each production area the list of authorised sites, the sampling site with the results of the latest analysis and the administrative decisions about the classification and closures of the area.

In the example below the Irish Marine Institute through the Irish Spatial Data Exchange provides datasets and maps for locations along the Irish coastline where commercial shellfish harvesting takes place. The figure shows an example of authorized shellfish production area, with sample points for bio-toxin and phytoplankton samples.

*Part 1: UML Case Diagram*

image::./media/image27.png[image,width=584,height=568, align=center]

*Part 2: Legislative Background*

Regulation 854/2004 on official controls on products of animal origin requires that bivalve mollusc are taken from classified production areas.

The areas are classified in one of the following categories according to the level of faecal contamination:

* Class A areas from which live bivalve molluscs may be collected for direct human consumption.
* Class B areas from which live bivalve molluscs may be collected, but placed on the market for human consumption only after treatment in a purification centre or after relaying so as to meet the health standards
* Class C areas from which live bivalve molluscs may be collected but placed on the market only after relaying over a long period so as to meet the health standards

Classified areas should be periodically monitored according to sampling programme to check for:

* the microbiological quality of live bivalve mollusc in relation to the production and relaying areas;
* the presence of toxin-producing plankton in production and relaying waters and biotoxins in live bivalve mollusc; and
* the presence of chemical contaminants in live bivalve molluscs.

The geographical distribution of the sampling points and the sampling frequency must ensure that the results of the analysis are as representative as possible for the area considered.

The sampling plan should take into account possible variations in the presence of plankton containing marine biotoxins and likely variation in faecal contamination.

If the results of the sampling programme show that health standards are exceeded or if there is a risk for human health, the production area is closed or re-classified.

The competent authorities must establish and keep up to date and communicate to interested parties a list of approved production and relaying areas, with details of their location, boundaries, classification and possible closures.

Definitions in the legislation (see Council Directive 2006/88/EC):

'mollusc farming area' means a production area or relaying area in which all aquaculture production businesses operate under a common biosecurity system;

'production area' means any freshwater, sea, estuarine, continental or lagoon area containing natural beds of molluscs or sites used for the cultivation of molluscs, and from which molluscs are taken;
