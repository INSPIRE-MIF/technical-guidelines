== How to read the document?

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Mineral Resources â€“ Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.0 rc3 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _Mineral Resources_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Mineral Resources_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Mineral Resources_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services â€“ General Executive Summary

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services&#44;] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML â€“ Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== _Mineral Resources_ â€“ Executive Summary

In the INSPIRE Directive, _Mineral Resources_ theme is defined as "Mineral resources including metal ores, industrial minerals, etc., where relevant including depth/height information on the extent of the resource".

To specify the scope of _Mineral Resources_ for INSPIRE, the terms contained in the definition have been clearly explained in the informal description section. Reference material has been analysed, and particularly:

* two legal texts providing requirements for the data specification:
** The EU Raw Materials Initiative;
** The Management of waste from extractive industries;
* the standard data model EarthResourceML for Mineral resources;
* the work currently done in raw materials related to European projects.

*The EU Raw Materials Initiative (2008)*

In this document, the Commission notices that there has been no integrated policy response at EU level up to now to ensure that it has sufficient access to raw materials at fair and undistorted prices. It is proposed that the EU should agree on an integrated raw materials strategy. Such a strategy should be based on the following 3 pillars:

* ensure *access to raw materials* from international markets under the same conditions as other industrial competitors;
* set the right *framework conditions* within the EU in order to foster sustainable supply of raw materials from European sources;
* boost overall resource efficiency and promote recycling to *reduce the EU's consumption of primary raw materials* and decrease the relative import dependence.

Two points are of particular interest for INSPIRE:

* The sustainable supply of raw materials based in the EU requires that *the knowledge base* of mineral deposits within the EU will be improved. In addition, the long term access to these deposits should be taken into account in land use planning.
* The Commission recommends better networking between the national geological surveys to facilitate the exchange of information and improve the interoperability of data and their dissemination, with particular attention to the needs of SMEs.

Any *land use policy for minerals* must utilise a robust digital geological knowledge base ensuring fair and equal consideration of all potential uses of land including the eventual extraction of raw materials.

To *improve the knowledge base* of mineral deposits in the EU the need for harmonised EU level data sets stands out.

*The Management of waste from extractive industries (Directive 2006/21/EC)*

One of the properties the waste characterisation shall include, where appropriate and in accordance with the category of the waste facility, is the description of expected physical and chemical characteristics of the waste to be deposited in the short and the long term, with particular reference to its stability under surface atmospheric/meteorological conditions, taking account of the type of mineral or minerals to be extracted and the nature of any overburden and/or gangue minerals that will be displaced in the course of the extractive operations.

A communication of the European Commission (COM(2011) 25 final) entitled 'TACKLING THE CHALLENGES IN COMMODITY MARKETS AND ON RAW MATERIALS**'** presents an overview of what has been achieved in each of these areas and of the steps which are planned to take the work forward. This document sets out targeted measures to secure and improve access to raw materials for the EU, and it also confirms that the needs expressed above are more than never of actuality.

*Examples of use of mineral resources*

The initial analysis of reference material and related activities has been completed by the description of the most relevant examples of use of mineral resources in various domains:

* Management of resources and exploitation activities: Providing information on inventoried mineral resources.
* Environmental impact assessments: mapping and measuring environmental geological parameters at desk, in the field and in laboratory, for assessing geological material to be used for construction and rehabilitation at the mine site.
* Mineral exploration: the quantitative assessment of undiscovered mineral resources, the modelling of mineral deposits, the mapping of lithological areas and units potentially hosting mineral deposits, the use of by-products from natural stone quarrying as "secondary aggregates" or as raw material for other industries.
* Promotion of private sector investment: providing geodata and services for mining and exploration companies.

From these examples, *four use cases are detailed:*

* Where to find germanium in Europe?
* What is the gold potential of Central and Southeastern Europe?
* Looking for the closest producers of Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC), allowing elaborating filler for the paper industry.
* Environmental uncertainties related to mining wastes.

This overview shows the wide range of use with various sets of mineral resources properties according to the use: the management of resources and exploitation activities does not request (most of the time) the same type of information about mineral resources than the assessment of the impact on environment, but some parameters may strongly interact on both domains.

The information about the location of the mine or mineral occurrence and some key attributes like the type of rocks or minerals mined (e.g. silicate â€“ sulphide â€“ radioactive) of _Mineral Resources_ can have a significant impact on the environment. This impact can be more or less strong depending on several other factors/parameters, and an appropriate knowledge about the _Mineral Resources_ can thus play an important role, as for example:

* The type of exploitation: the environmental impact of an open-pit in terms of surface area used/land use problems / visual pollution is not the same as for an underground exploitation (which also sometimes can store wastes depending on the exploitation method).
* The geometry of the deposit (extent, shape, dip, width) â€“ and also the grades of reserves and resourcesâ€“ which will strongly influence the type of exploitation.
* The type of ore, which will determine the type of mineral processing and therefore the type and quantity of wastes.

The *core data model for Mineral Resources,* which is based on the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML developed by the international geosciences community, in particular Geological Survey Organisations (http://www.geosciml.org/), provides the main object types and properties requested by all examples of use: the location of mineral resources (Mines and Earth Resources), the main commodities, and the exploitation type.

The TWG has also elaborated the first draft of a data model that conceptually extends the data scope of the INSPIRE Mineral Resource core data model to address the requirements from the Raw Materials Initiative and the Mining Waste Directive utilizing the GeoSciML and Earth ResourceML community data models (see the Annex D of this document).

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Mineral Resources_ as defined in Annex III of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme _Mineral Resources_.

=== Informal description

*[.underline]#Definition:#*

Mineral resources including metal ores, industrial minerals, etc., where relevant including depth/height information on the extent of the resource. [Directive 2007/2/EC]

*[.underline]#Description:#*

From the definition, we detail each word.

*Mineral resource* means a naturally occurring concentration/accumulation of organic or inorganic material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the Earth's crust such as energy fuels, metal ores, industrial minerals and construction minerals, but excluding water, in such form and quality that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction

*Mineral raw material* (not in the definition) is a natural inorganic or organic substance, such as metallic ores, industrial minerals, construction materials or energy fuels, but excluding water.

**Metal ores t**he usage favors the wording "*Metallic ores*" instead of "Metal ores".

*Ore* (sensu lato): Any naturally occurring (raw) material from which a mineral or aggregate can be extracted at a profit.

Although more than 4,400 mineral species are known, only about 100 are considered ore minerals. The term 'ore' originally applied only to metallic minerals but now includes such non-metallic substances as sulphur, calcium fluoride (fluorite), and barium sulfate (barite). Ore is always mixed with unwanted rocks and minerals, known collectively as gangue. The ore and the gangue are mined together and then separated. The desired element (often a metal which is usually contained in chemical combination with some other element in addition to various impurities) is then extracted from the ore. It may be still further refined (purified) or alloyed with other metals.

*A Metal (metallic) ore* is thus a type of rock (mineral raw material) from which metal can be extracted at a profit.

Metals may be present in ores in the native form (such as native copper), or as noble metals (not usually forming compounds, such as gold), but more commonly they occur combined as oxides, sulphides, sulphates, silicates, etc. Actually, the generic wording 'metals' covers 'true' metals (see Periodic Table of Elements) but also includes semi-metallic substances or metalloids such as 'As' and 'Ge' which are often intimately associated with metals.

*Industrial minerals* and rocks are minerals which are neither metallic nor used as fuels, but which are mined and processed for their economic use. A broader definition describes an industrial mineral as any rock, mineral, or naturally occurring substance of economic value, exclusive of metallic ores and mineral fuels, and gemstones. In essence, they are the raw materials used in many industrial, agricultural and construction products. However, *for convenience*, gemstones are frequently grouped together with industrial minerals under one umbrella.

*Depth/height information:* This information, if provided alone, is of limited interest. It should be linked with information related to the type and the morphology of the deposit (e.g., vein, massive deposit, layer, etc.) and its geometry, in particular the dip. The depth/height of the deposit, combined with information related to the morphology and the geometry, will contribute to define the operating method (e.g., open pit vs. underground mining) and notably the thickness of overburden to remove in case of open pit mining.

==== The main spatial object / data types of _Mineral Resources_ data specification

The main spatial object / data types are Mineral Occurrence, the Commodity, the Mine and the Exploration activity, and the Mining activity.

*The MineralResources data model:*

The *Mining Feature* class represents a conceptual feature that exists coherently in the world and corresponds with a "*Mine*" or a "*Mining Activity*", locatable and identifiable features in time and/or space. The *Mining Feature Occurrence* is an occurrence of a Mining Feature, it carries some properties and the geometry and/or location.

* A *Mine* is an excavation for the extraction of mineral deposits. 'True' mines are underground workings and open-pit workings (also called open-sky mines) generally for the extraction of metallic commodities. The Mine spatial object type also includes open workings generally for the extraction of industrial minerals, commonly referred to as quarries.
* The *Mining Activity*, related to a Mine, describes the process of extracting metallic or non-metallic mineral deposits from the Earth.

The *Earth Resource* identifies the kinds of observable or inferred phenomena required to classify economic and sub-economic earth resources:

* The *Mineral Occurrence* could be a prospect, an occurrence, a mineral deposit, an ore deposit, etc. (but not a lode, a field, a district, or a province).
* The *Commodity* describes the material of economic interest in the Earth Resource.
* The *Ore Measure* is an estimated or calculated amount of ore and grade that exist within an Earth Resource, in terms of its resource, reserve and endowment.
* The *Mineral Deposit Model* describes the essential attributes of a class of mineral deposits used to classify the Earth Resource.
* An Earth Resource has an associated *Exploration Activity* to describe the process leading to the discovery and assessment of the resource.

The MineralResources data model uses classes from the INSPIRE Geology Data Model: an Earth Resource is a Geologic Feature, which has a geometry (a MappedFeature) and an age (GeologicEvent).

Exploration history is needed for quantitative assessment of possibly existing, yet undiscovered mineral resources of an area (e.g. USGS predictivity approach). Such information can also help to evaluate the potential of an occurrence (e.g. sampling survey; drilling survey).

The notion of metallogenic district is particularly useful and is present in several databases. It allows a deposit to be placed in a more general frame and to tackle the concept of mining potential at a regional scale. In the MineralResources model this can be described using the MineralOccurrence type property.

*Mineral resource anomalies*

Anomalies are defined in the D2.3 Document D2.3 Definition of Annex Themes and Scope:


*"Anomalies*: locations where background concentrations of potentially valuable elements in soils, stream sediments or rocks onshore or offshore exceed the normal background values expected given the local geological context. Such maps are widely used in mineral exploration. Attributes are location, chemical elements, nature of the sampled element (s), analytical value(s)"


Anomalies are not only of geochemical nature, but can also be geophysical. An anomaly has no intrinsic value until it has been properly characterized through (i) a detailed geological survey, (ii) a more detailed geophysical/geochemical survey ("tactical" grids with a smaller cell size for measurement/sampling) and (iii) if the interest is confirmed, a reconnaissance drilling survey.

A majority of anomalies never open onto the discovery of a deposit, being often related to lithological heterogeneities in the crust. In some cases, they may indicate that a mineralizing process started but rapidly aborted, leading to no mineral concentration. On the other hand, many deposits are not (or never) marked by geophysical/geochemical anomalies for several reasons: depth, overburden screen, lack of contrast between the host rock and the ore body, etc..

Even if geochemical/geophysical surveys are useful for "predictivity" mapping, most of the time, only large-scale surveys published by public bodies are available. Their interest is generally very limited. Detailed surveys made by private companies are rarely accessible because of their strategic importance.

All these reasons together do not invite to include "Anomalies" in the scope of _Mineral Resources_. An "Anomaly" database would be a huge collection of objects for which nobody would have a clear idea of the meaning. Most of the Geological Surveys do not maintain such a database.

*[.underline]#Definition:#*

Mineral resources including metal ores, industrial minerals, etc., where relevant including depth/height information on the extent of the resource. [Directive 2007/2/EC]

*[.underline]#Description:#*

The Mineral resources data theme refers to the description of natural concentrations of very diverse mineral resources of potential or proven economic interest. The important attributes such as the nature, genesis, location, extent, mining and distribution of resources reflect the two main identified categories of potential use. These are:

* Management of resources and their exploitation and exploration activities: provision of information on inventoried mineral resources as well as on the quantitative assessment of undiscovered mineral resources and the modelling of mineral deposits.

* Environmental impact assessments: mapping and measuring environmental geological parameters for assessing geological material to be used for construction and rehabilitation at the mine site.

The Mineral resources data model is organised around two major categories of information: description and location of mines and mining activities; the description and location of "earth resources" including their classification, estimates of amount, as well as a description of the main market commodities. The energy resources such as coal, oil and gas are excluded in this theme, as they are found in theme "energy resources".

=== How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 1 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

*Figure 1 - Relationship between INSPIRE Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines*

==== Requirements

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Mineral Resources_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme _Mineral Resources_ in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:


[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X* 

This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.

====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X* 

Recommendations are shown using this style.
====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

<<<
== Specification scopes

This data specification does not distinguish different specification scopes, but just considers one general scope.

NOTE For more information on specification scopes, see [ISO 19131:2007], clause 8 and Annex D.

<<<
== Identification information

These Technical Guidelines are identified by the following URI:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/tg/mr/3.0 rc3

NOTE ISO 19131 suggests further identification information to be included in this section, e.g. the title, abstract or spatial representation type. The proposed items are already described in the document metadata, executive summary, overview description (section 2) and descriptions of the application schemas (section 5). In order to avoid redundancy, they are not repeated here.

<<<
== Data content and structure

=== Application schemas â€“ Overview 

==== Application schemas included in the IRs

Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Implementing Rules lay down the requirements for the content and structure of the data sets related to the INSPIRE Annex themes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 4_
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme _Mineral Resources_ are defined in the following application schemas (see section 5.3) ):

* MineralResources application schema describes the core normative concepts that build up the INSPIRE Mineral resources data theme

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

NOTE The application schemas presented in this section contain some additional information that is not included in the Implementing Rules, in particular multiplicities of attributes and association roles.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 1*

Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the multiplicities defined for the attributes and association roles in this section.

====

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

==== Additional recommended application schemas 

In addition to the application schema listed above, the following additional application schema have been defined for the theme _Mineral Resources_ (see Annex D):

* *_MineralResourcesExtension_* application schema represents a conceptual extension of the data scope of the core MR data model. However this extension is using the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML classes to address additional requirements of EU Raw Materials Initiative and the Mining Waste Directive.

These additional application schemas are not included in the IRs. They typically address requirements from specific (groups of) use cases and/or may be used to provide additional information. They are included in this specification in order to improve interoperability also for these additional aspects and to illustrate the extensibility of the application schemas included in the IRs.

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema â€“ across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 5_
*Types*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.
. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 1 below.

[.text-center]
*Table 1 â€“ Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[align=center,width="100%",cols="22%,14%,64%",options="header",]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided â€“ either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the Â«voidableÂ» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the Â«voidableÂ» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=5]
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

. Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:
[loweralpha]
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;
.. code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 2*

Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 3*

Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows.
+
INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>/<value>.

* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined.
+
Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists.
+
The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:
+
** The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.
** The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".
** In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.
** The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones.

+
Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.


[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 4*

The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<UpperCamelCaseName>_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "\{complete,disjoint}".

==== Identifier management

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.

. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

====

NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier which is published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. [DS-D2.5]

NOTE 2 Article 9(1) is implemented in each application schema by including the attribute _inspireId_ of type Identifier.

NOTE 3 Article 9(2) is ensured if the _namespace_ and _localId_ attributes of the Identifier remains the same for different versions of a spatial object; the _version_ attribute can of course change.

==== Geometry representation

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_
*Other Requirements & Rules*

. The value domain of spatial properties defined in this Regulation shall be restricted to the Simple Feature spatial schema as defined in Herring, John R. (ed.), OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information â€“ Simple feature access â€“ Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 10_
*Life-cycle of Spatial Objects*

(...)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where the attributes beginLifespanVersion and endLifespanVersion are used, the value of endLifespanVersion shall not be before the value of beginLifespanVersion.

====

NOTE The requirement expressed in the IR Requirement above will be included as constraints in the UML data models of all themes.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 5*

If life-cycle information is not maintained as part of the spatial data set, all spatial objects belonging to this data set should provide a void value with a reason of "unpopulated".

=== Application schema Mineral Resources

==== Description

===== Narrative description and UML Overview

An overview of the MineralResourcesCore application schema is given in Figure 2. This figure shows only the spatial object types, data types and their relationships. The properties are not visible at this stage but are described in following figures.

As can be seen the data model has two principal components: one, centred on EarthResource, de-scribes the natural material of potential economic value (Figure 3 and Figure 4), and the other, centred on MiningFeature (Figure 5), describes the working of the EarthResource.

image::./media/image5.png[./media/image5,width=604,height=547]

[.text-center]
*Figure 2 â€“ UML class diagram: Overview of the MineralResources application schema*

The Earth Resource identifies the kinds of observable or inferred phenomena required to classify economic and sub-economic earth resources:

* The MineralOccurrence could be a prospect, an occurrence, a mineral deposit, an ore deposit (but not a lode, a field, a district or a province)
* The Commodity describes the material of economic interest in the EarthResource
* CommodityMeasure provides a measure of the amount of the commodity (as opposed to the amount of ore) based on a Reserve, Resource or Endowment calculation
* The OreMeasure is an estimated or calculated amount of ore and grade that exist within an EarthResource, in terms of its resource, reserve and endowment
* The MineralDepositModel describes the essential attributes of a class of mineral deposits used to classify the EarthResource
* An EarthResource has an associated ExplorationActivity to describe the process leading to the discovery and assessment of the resource.

The abstract MiningFeature class represents a conceptual feature that exists coherently in the world. This corresponds with a Mine or a Mining Activity, locatable and identifiable features in time and/or space.

The resourceExtraction association from EarthResource to MiningActivity enables the Mining Activity which extracts the Earth Resource to be described.

*[.underline]#EarthResource:#*

The diagram for EarthResource is split in two figures for better readability (Figure 3 and Figure 4).

image::./media/image6.png[./media/image6,width=604,height=676]

[.text-center]
*Figure 3 â€“ UML class diagram: MineralResources (EarthResource) â€“ part I*

image::./media/image7.png[./media/image7,width=604,height=578]

[.text-center]
*Figure 4 â€“ UML class diagram: MineralResources (EarthResource) â€“ part II*

A MineralOccurrence is a type of EarthResource, and the explorationHistory association from EarthResource to ExplorationActivity describes which kinds of works were carried out to find, and evaluate the MineralOccurrence.

The MineralResources data model uses the INSPIRE Geology Data Model to describe geological components. The EarthResource class inherits the super class GeologicFeature from Geology. Geometry is provided by the occurrence association between GeologicFeature and MappedFeature shown in the Geology data specification.

The commodityDescription association from EarthResource to Commodity describes the material of economic interest in the Earth Resource.

The oreAmount association from EarthResource to OreMeasure provides the estimate of the amount and dimension of the Earth Resource.

The OreMeasure can be a Resource, Reserve or Endowment. The category for Resource indicates if the resource is measured, indicated, proved, probable, or inferred, and for Reserve identifies the level of confidence of the estimate. An indicator ("includes reserves and/or resources") states what is included or not in the estimate.

The measureDetails association from OreMeasure to CommodityMeasure provides a measure of the amount of the commodity (as opposed to the amount of ore) based on a Reserve, Resource or Endowment calculation. This measure is obtained by multiplying the ore tonnage by the average grade of the commodity within the ore (generally expressed in tons of metal).

The commodityOfInterest association from CommodityMeasure to Commodity states which commodity may be of interest inside a deposit. A deposit may be a very large deposit for one commodity (this commodity is the main one) and only a medium-sized deposit for some other commodities. Such a ranking necessitates a (statistical) comparison with a large set of deposits throughout the world to ensure that it is valid.

The classification association from EarthResource to MineralDepositModel provides the systematically arranged information describing the essential attributes of a class of mineral deposits. This may be empirical (descriptive) or theoretical (genetic).

The resourceExtraction association from EarthResource to MiningActivity enables the Mining Activity which extracts the Earth Resource to be described. Figure 3 illustrates the part of the core data specification that describes the working of the Earth Resource.

The abstract MiningFeature class represents a conceptual feature that exists coherently in the world. This corresponds with a Mine or a Mining Activity, locatable and identifiable features in time and/or space.

* A Mine is an excavation for the extraction of mineral deposits. 'True' mines are underground workings and open-pit workings (also called open-sky mines) generally for the extraction of metallic commodities. The Mine feature also includes open workings generally for the extraction of industrial minerals, commonly referred to as quarries.
* The Mining Activity, related to a Mine, describes the process of extracting metallic or non-metallic mineral deposits from the Earth.

The MiningFeatureOccurrence carries the geometry of a MiningFeature.

The relatedActivity association from Mine to MiningActivity describes one or more periods of activity of the Mine. The reverse association, associatedMine, describes the Mine associated with a particular period of activity.

The deposit association from MiningActivity to EarthResource allows the detailed description of the deposit worked during the Mining Activity.

!Description: !Several commodities may be of interest inside a deposit. A deposit may be a very large deposit for one commodity (this commodity is the main one) and only a medium-sized deposit for some other commodities. Such a ranking is based on a statistical study of a large set of deposits throughout the world to ensure that it is valid. It is made using histograms allowing for each commodity to define class boundaries and what is a super large, a large, a medium-sized etc deposit for this commodity. This classification is based on the potential or endowment: reserves  resources.

== Reference systems, units of measure and grids

=== Default reference systems, units of measure and grid

The reference systems, units of measure and geographic grid systems included in this sub-section are the defaults to be used for all INSPIRE data sets, unless theme-specific exceptions and/or additional requirements are defined in section 6.2.

==== Coordinate reference systems

===== Datum

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.2_
*Datum for three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems*

For the three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems and the horizontal component of compound coordinate reference systems used for making spatial data sets available, the datum shall be the datum of the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) in areas within its geographical scope, or the datum of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) or other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with ITRS in areas that are outside the geographical scope of ETRS89. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of the ITRS and there is a well documented relationship between both systems, according to EN ISO 19111.

====

===== Coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.3_
*Coordinate Reference Systems*

Spatial data sets shall be made available using at least one of the coordinate reference systems specified in sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, unless one of the conditions specified in section 1.3.4 holds.

*1.3.1. Three-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.
* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

*1.3.2. Two-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate reference system.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Transverse Mercator coordinate reference system.

*1.3.3. Compound Coordinate Reference Systems*

--
. For the horizontal component of the compound coordinate reference system, one of the coordinate reference systems specified in section 1.3.2 shall be used.

. For the vertical component, one of the following coordinate reference systems shall be used:
--

* For the vertical component on land, the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) shall be used to express gravity-related heights within its geographical scope. Other vertical reference systems related to the Earth gravity field shall be used to express gravity-related heights in areas that are outside the geographical scope of EVRS.
* For the vertical component in the free atmosphere, barometric pressure, converted to height using ISO 2533:1975 International Standard Atmosphere, or other linear or parametric reference systems shall be used. Where other parametric reference systems are used, these shall be described in an accessible reference using EN ISO 19111-2:2012.
* For the vertical component in marine areas where there is an appreciable tidal range (tidal waters), the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) shall be used as the reference surface.
* For the vertical component in marine areas without an appreciable tidal range, in open oceans and effectively in waters that are deeper than 200 meters, the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or a well-defined reference level close to the MSL shall be used as the reference surface.

*1.3.4. Other Coordinate Reference Systems*

Exceptions, where other coordinate reference systems than those listed in 1.3.1, 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 may be used, are:

. Other coordinate reference systems may be specified for specific spatial data themes in this Annex.

. For regions outside of continental Europe, Member States may define suitable coordinate reference systems.

The geodetic codes and parameters needed to describe these coordinate reference systems and to allow conversion and transformation operations shall be documented and an identifier shall be created, according to EN ISO 19111 and ISO 19127.

====

===== Display

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.4_
*Coordinate Reference Systems used in the View Network Service*

For the display of spatial data sets with the view network service as specified in Regulation No 976/2009, at least the coordinate reference systems for two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude) shall be available.

====

===== Identifiers for coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.5_
*Coordinate Reference System Identifiers*

. Coordinate reference system parameters and identifiers shall be managed in one or several common registers for coordinate reference systems.

. Only identifiers contained in a common register shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems listed in this Section.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to use the http URIs provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium as coordinate reference system identifiers (see identifiers for the default CRSs below). These are based on and redirect to the definition in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry (_http://www.epsg-registry.org/_).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 2*

The identifiers listed in Table 2 shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems used in a data set.

====

NOTE CRS identifiers may be used e.g. in:

* data encoding,
* data set and service metadata, and
* requests to INSPIRE network services.

==== Temporal reference system

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 11_
*Temporal Reference Systems*

. The default temporal reference system referred to in point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (footnote:[OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12.]) shall be used, unless other temporal reference systems are specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE 1 Point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (the INSPIRE Metadata IRs) states that the default reference system shall be the Gregorian calendar, with dates expressed in accordance with ISO 8601.

NOTE 2 ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats â€“ Information interchange â€“ Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. The standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears first in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It also provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information across time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

EXAMPLE 1997 (the year 1997), 1997-07-16 (16^th^ July 1997), 1997-07-16T19:20:3001:00 (16^th^ July 1997, 19h 20' 30'', time zone: UTC1)

==== Units of measure

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_

*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 2.2_
*Grids*

Either of the grids with fixed and unambiguously defined locations defined in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 shall be used as a geo-referencing framework to make gridded data available in INSPIRE, unless one of the following conditions holds:

. Other grids may be specified for specific spatial data themes in Annexes II-IV. In this case, data exchanged using such a theme-specific grid shall use standards in which the grid definition is either included with the data, or linked by reference.
. For grid referencing in regions outside of continental Europe Member States may define their own grid based on a geodetic coordinate reference system compliant with ITRS and a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, following the same principles as laid down for the grid specified in Section 2.2.1. In this case, an identifier for the coordinate reference system shall be created.

*2.2 Equal Area Grid*

The grid is based on the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (ETRS89-LAEA) coordinate reference system with the centre of the projection at the point 52^o^ N, 10^o^ E and false easting: x~0~ = 4321000Â m, false northing: y~0~ = 3210000Â m.

The origin of the grid coincides with the false origin of the ETRS89-LAEA coordinate reference system (x=0, y=0).

Grid points of grids based on ETRS89-LAEA shall coincide with grid points of the grid.

The grid is hierarchical, with resolutions of 1m, 10m, 100m, 1000m, 10000m and 100000m.

The grid orientation is south-north, west-east.

The grid is designated as Grid_ETRS89-LAEA. For identification of an individual resolution level the cell size in metres is appended.

For the unambiguous referencing and identification of a grid cell, the cell code composed of the size of the cell and the coordinates of the lower left cell corner in ETRS89-LAEA shall be used. The cell size shall be denoted in metres ("m") for cell sizes up to 100m or kilometres ("km") for cell sizes of 1000m and above. Values for northing and easting shall be divided by 10^n^, where _n_ is the number of trailing zeros in the cell size value.

== Data quality

This chapter includes a description of the data quality elements and sub-elements as well as the corresponding data quality measures that should be used to evaluate and document data quality for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Mineral Resources_ (section 7.1).

It may also define requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Mineral Resources_ (sections 7.2 and 7.3).

In particular, the data quality elements, sub-elements and measures specified in section 7.1 should be used for

* evaluating and documenting data quality properties and constraints of spatial objects, where such properties or constraints are defined as part of the application schema(s) (see section 5);
* evaluating and documenting data quality metadata elements of spatial data sets (see section 8); and/or
* specifying requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Mineral Resources_ (see sections 7.2 and 7.3).

The descriptions of the elements and measures are based on Annex D of ISO/DIS 19157 Geographic information â€“ Data quality.

=== Data quality elements

Table 3 lists all data quality elements and sub-elements that are being used in this specification. Data quality information can be evaluated at level of spatial object, spatial object type, dataset or dataset series. The level at which the evaluation is performed is given in the "Evaluation Scope" column.

The measures to be used for each of the listed data quality sub-elements are defined in the following sub-sections.

==== Logical consistency â€“ Conceptual consistency

The Application Schema conformance class of the Abstract Test Suite in Annex I defines a number of tests to evaluate the conceptual consistency (tests A.1.1-A.1.8) of a data set including the theme specific test (A1.8).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 6*

For the tests on conceptual consistency, it is recommended to use the _Logical consistency â€“ Conceptual consistency_ data quality sub-element and the measure _Number of items not compliant with the rules of the conceptual schema_ as specified in the table below.

== Dataset-level metadata

This section specifies dataset-level metadata elements, which should be used for documenting metadata for a complete dataset or dataset series.

NOTE Metadata can also be reported for each individual spatial object (spatial object-level metadata). Spatial object-level metadata is fully described in the application schema(s) (section 5).

For some dataset-level metadata elements, in particular those for reporting data quality and maintenance, a more specific scope can be specified. This allows the definition of metadata at sub-dataset level, e.g. separately for each spatial object type (see instructions for the relevant metadata element).

=== Metadata elements defined in INSPIRE Metadata Regulation

Table 4 gives an overview of the metadata elements specified in Regulation 1205/2008/EC (implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata).

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to the relevant section in the Metadata Regulation, which contains a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.
* The fourth column specifies the condition, under which the given element becomes mandatory.

Generic guidelines for implementing these elements using ISO 19115 and 19119 are available at _http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101_. The following sections describe additional theme-specific recommendations and requirements for implementing these elements.

==== Conformity

The _Conformity_ metadata element defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC requires to report the conformance with the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services. In addition, it may be used also to document the conformance to another specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 8*

Dataset metadata should include a statement on the overall conformance of the dataset with this data specification (i.e. conformance with all requirements).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 9*

The _Conformity_ metadata element should be used to document conformance with this data specification (as a whole), with a specific conformance class defined in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A and/or with another specification.

====

The _Conformity_ element includes two sub-elements, the _Specification_ (a citation of the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services or other specification), and the _Degree_ of conformity. The _Degree_ can be _Conformant_ (if the dataset is fully conformant with the cited specification), _Not Conformant_ (if the dataset does not conform to the cited specification) or _Not Evaluated_ (if the conformance has not been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 10*

If a dataset is not yet conformant with all requirements of this data specification, it is recommended to include information on the conformance with the individual conformance classes specified in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 11*

If a dataset is produced or transformed according to an external specification that includes specific quality assurance procedures, the conformity with this specification should be documented using the _Conformity_ metadata element.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 12*

If minimum data quality recommendations are defined then the statement on the conformity with these requirements should be included using the _Conformity_ metadata element and referring to the relevant data quality conformance class in the Abstract Test Suite.

====

NOTE Currently no minimum data quality requirements are included in the IRs. The recommendation above should be included as a requirement in the IRs if minimum data quality requirements are defined at some point in the future.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 13*

When documenting conformance with this data specification or one of the conformance classes defined in the Abstract Test Suite, the _Specification_ sub-element should be given using the http URI identifier of the conformance class or using a citation including the following elements:

* title: "INSPIRE Data Specification on _Mineral Resources_ â€“ Draft Guidelines â€“ <name of the conformance class>"
* date:
** dateType: publication
** date: 2013-02-05

==== Lineage

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 14*

Following the ISO/DIS 19157 Quality principles, if a data provider has a procedure for the quality management of their spatial data sets then the appropriate data quality elements and measures defined in ISO/DIS 19157 should be used to evaluate and report (in the metadata) the results. If not, the _Lineage_ metadata element (defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC) should be used to describe the overall quality of a spatial data set.

====

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, lineage "is a statement on process history and/or overall quality of the spatial data set. Where appropriate it may include a statement whether the data set has been validated or quality assured, whether it is the official version (if multiple versions exist), and whether it has legal validity. The value domain of this metadata element is free text".

The Metadata Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119 specifies that the statement sub-element of LI_Lineage (EN ISO 19115) should be used to implement the lineage metadata element.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 15*

To describe the transformation steps and related source data, it is recommended to use the following sub-elements of LI_Lineage:

* For the description of the transformation process of the local to the common INSPIRE data structures, the LI_ProcessStep sub-element should be used.

* For the description of the source data the LI_Source sub-element should be used.

====

NOTE 1 In order to improve the interoperability, domain templates and instructions for using these free text elements (descriptive statements) may be specified here and/or in an Annex of this data specification.

==== Temporal reference

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, at least one of the following temporal reference metadata sub-elements shall be provided: temporal extent, date of publication, date of last revision, date of creation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 16*

It is recommended that at least the date of the last revision of a spatial data set should be reported using the _Date of last revision_ metadata sub-element.

====

=== Metadata elements for interoperability

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 13_
*Metadata required for Interoperability*

The metadata describing a spatial data set shall include the following metadata elements required for interoperability:

. Coordinate Reference System: Description of the coordinate reference system(s) used in the data set.

. Temporal Reference System: Description of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.

. Encoding: Description of the computer language construct(s) specifying the representation of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device or transmission channel.

. Topological Consistency: Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the data set as described by the scope.
+
This element is mandatory only if the data set includes types from the Generic Network Model and does not assure centreline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for the network.

. Character Encoding: The character encoding used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if an encoding is used that is not based on UTF-8.

. Spatial Representation Type: The method used to spatially represent geographic information.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to implement the required metadata elements based on ISO 19115 and ISO/TS 19139.

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with the proposed encoding.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 3*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the used ISO 19139 XML schema.

====

NOTE Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 4*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall contain the elements and meet the INSPIRE multiplicity specified in the sections below.

====

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 5*

The elements specified below shall be available in the specified ISO/TS 19139 path.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 17*

The metadata elements for interoperability should be made available together with the metadata elements defined in the Metadata Regulation through an INSPIRE discovery service.

====

NOTE While this not explicitly required by any of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, making all metadata of a data set available together and through one service simplifies implementation and usability.

==== Metadata elements for reporting data quality

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 20*

For reporting the results of the data quality evaluation, the data quality elements, sub-elements and (for quantitative evaluation) measures defined in chapter 7 should be used.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 21*

The metadata elements specified in the following sections should be used to report the results of the data quality evaluation. At least the information included in the row "Implementation instructions" should be provided.

====

The first section applies to reporting quantitative results (using the element DQ_QuantitativeResult), while the second section applies to reporting non-quantitative results (using the element DQ_DescriptiveResult).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 22*

If a dataset does not pass the tests of the Application schema conformance class (defined in Annex A), the results of each test should be reported using one of the options described in sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2.

====

NOTE 1 If using non-quantitative description, the results of several tests do not have to be reported separately, but may be combined into one descriptive statement.

NOTE 2 The sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2 may need to be updated once the XML schemas for ISO 19157 have been finalised.

The scope for reporting may be different from the scope for evaluating data quality (see section 7). If data quality is reported at the data set or spatial object type level, the results are usually derived or aggregated.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 23*

The scope element (of type DQ_Scope) of the DQ_DataQuality subtype should be used to encode the reporting scope.

Only the following values should be used for the level element of DQ_Scope: Series, Dataset, featureType.

If the level is featureType the levelDescription/MDScopeDescription/features element (of type Set< GF_FeatureType>) shall be used to list the feature type names.

== Delivery

=== Updates

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 8_
*Updates*

. Member States shall make available updates of data on a regular basis.

. All updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set, unless a different period is specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE In this data specification, no exception is specified, so all updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set.

=== Delivery medium

According to Article 11(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for INSPIRE spatial data sets and services. The relevant network service types for making spatial data available are:

* _view services_ making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;
* _download services_, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;
* _transformation services_, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability.

NOTE For the relevant requirements and recommendations for network services, see the relevant Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelinesfootnote:[The Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines on INSPIRE Network Services are available at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/5].

EXAMPLE 1 Through the Get Spatial Objects function, a download service can either download a pre-defined data set or pre-defined part of a data set (non-direct access download service), or give direct access to the spatial objects contained in the data set, and download selections of spatial objects based upon a query (direct access download service). To execute such a request, some of the following information might be required:

* the list of spatial object types and/or predefined data sets that are offered by the download service (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation),
* and the query capabilities section advertising the types of predicates that may be used to form a query expression (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation, where applicable),
* a description of spatial object types offered by a download service instance (to be provided through the Describe Spatial Object Types operation).

EXAMPLE 2 Through the Transform function, a transformation service carries out data content transformations from native data forms to the INSPIRE-compliant form and vice versa. If this operation is directly called by an application to transform source data (e.g. obtained through a download service) that is not yet conformant with this data specification, the following parameters are required:

Input data (mandatory). The data set to be transformed.

* Source model (mandatory, if cannot be determined from the input data). The model in which the input data is provided.
* Target model (mandatory). The model in which the results are expected.
* Model mapping (mandatory, unless a default exists). Detailed description of how the transformation is to be carried out.

=== Encodings

The IRs contain the following two requirements for the encoding to be used to make data available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 7_
*Encoding*

. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall conform to EN ISO 19118. In particular, it shall specify schema conversion rules for all spatial object types and all attributes and association roles and the output data structure used.

. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall be made available.

====

NOTE ISO 19118:2011 specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules used for interchange of geographic data within the set of International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". An encoding rule allows geographic information defined by application schemas and standardized schemas to be coded into a system-independent data structure suitable for transport and storage. The encoding rule specifies the types of data being coded and the syntax, structure and coding schemes used in the resulting data structure. Specifically, ISO 19118:2011 includes

* requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas,
* requirements for creating encoding services, and
* requirements for XML-based encoding rules for neutral interchange of data.

While the IRs do not oblige the usage of a specific encoding, these Technical Guidelines propose to make data related to the spatial data theme _Mineral Resources_ available at least in the default encoding(s) specified in section 0. In this section, a number of TG requirements are listed that need to be met in order to be conformant with the default encoding(s).

The proposed default encoding(s) meet the requirements in Article 7 of the IRs, i.e. they are conformant with ISO 19118 and (since they are included in this specification) publicly available.

==== Default Encoding(s)

===== Specific requirements for GML encoding

This data specification proposes the use of GML as the default encoding, as recommended in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of [DS-D2.7]. GML is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118, as required in Article 7(1). For details, see [ISO 19136], and in particular Annex E (UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules).

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with GML encodings.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 6*

Data instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the provided XML schema.

====

NOTE 1 Not all constraints defined in the application schemas can be mapped to XML. Therefore, the following requirement is necessary.

NOTE 2 The obligation to use only the allowed code list values specified for attributes and most of the constraints defined in the application schemas [.underline]#cannot# be mapped to the XML sch. They can therefore [.underline]#not# be enforced through schema validation. It may be possible to express some of these constraints using other schema or rule languages (e.g. Schematron), in order to enable automatic validation.

===== Default encoding(s) for application schema MineralResources

*Name: MineralResources GML Application Schema*
Version: version 3.0
Specification: D2.8.III.21 Data Specification on _Mineral Resources_ â€“ Technical Guidelines
Character set: UTF-8

The xml schema document is available on the INSPIRE website
_http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/mr/3.0/MineralResources.xsd._

==== Recommended Encoding(s)

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 24*

It is recommended that also the encodings specified in this section be provided for the relevant application schemas.

====

===== The use of EarthResourceML encoding 

*Name: EarthResourceML*
Version: 2.0
Specification: http://_www.earthresourceml.org_
Character set: UTF-8
EarthResourceML v 2.0 is the community developed exchange format for providing detailed information on earth resources including waste as a secondary resource. It also served as the basis for both the more simplified INSPIRE Mineral Resource core data model and the Mineral Resource extension model. More information about the use of EarthResourceML for INSPIRE will be available at: http://_www.earthresourceml.org_

NOTE *_The difference between the INSPIRE core data model and EarthResourceML is very small since version 2.0 of EarthResourceML was influenced by the INSPIRE development. However the unique encoding solution to fully address both INSPIRE and EarthResourceML requirements still needs to be tested by the wider stakeholder community as part of the INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation Framework. Based on the results, it should be discussed whether the current default INSPIRE encoding (see Section 9.3.1. ) can be replaced by the EarthResourceML encoding._*

== Data Capture

There is no specific guidance required with respect to data capture.

== Portrayal

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for this theme. Portrayal is regulated in Article 14 of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

. For the portrayal of spatial data sets using a view network service as specified in Commission Regulation No 976/2009 (footnote:[OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9.]), the following shall be available:
[loweralpha]
.. the layers specified in Annex II for the theme or themes the data set is related to;
.. for each layer at least a default portrayal style, with as a minimum an associated title and a unique identifier.

[arabic, start=2]
. For each layer, Annex II defines the following:
[loweralpha]
.. a human readable title of the layer to be used for display in user interface;
.. the spatial object type(s), or sub-set thereof, that constitute(s) the content of the layer.

====

In section 11.1, the _types_ of layers are defined that are to be used for the portrayal of the spatial object types defined in this specification. A view service may offer several layers of the same type, one for each dataset that it offers data on a specific topic.

NOTE The layer specification in the IRs only contains the name, a human readable title and the (subset(s) of) spatial object type(s), that constitute(s) the content of the layer. In addition, these Technical Guidelines suggest keywords for describing the layer.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 25*

It is recommended to use the keywords specified in section 11.1 in the _Layers Metadata parameters_ of the INSPIRE View service (see Annex III, Part A, section 2.2.4 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009).

====

Section 11.2 specifies one style for each of these layers. It is proposed that INSPIRE view services support this style as the default style required by Article 14(1b).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 7*

For each layer specified in this section, the styles defined in section 11.2 shall be available.

====

NOTE The default style should be used for portrayal by the view network service if no user-defined style is specified in a portrayal request for a specific layer.

In section 11.3, further styles can be specified that represent examples of styles typically used in a thematic domain. It is recommended that also these styles should be supported by INSPIRE view services, where applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 26*

In addition, it is recommended that, where applicable, INSPIRE view services also support the styles defined in section 11.3.

====

Where XML fragments are used in the following sections, the following namespace prefixes apply:

* sld="http://www.opengis.net/sld"Â (WMS/SLD 1.1)
* se="http://www.opengis.net/se"Â (SE 1.1)
* ogc="http://www.opengis.net/ogc"Â (FE 1.1)

=== Layers to be provided by INSPIRE view services

|===

NOTE The table above contains several layers for the spatial object type(s) <spatial object type names>, which can be further classified using a code list-valued attribute. Such sets of layers are specified as described in Article 14(3) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

(...)

[arabic, start=3]
. For spatial object types whose objects can be further classified using a code list-valued attribute, several layers may be defined. Each of these layers shall include the spatial objects corresponding to one specific code list value. In the definition of such sets of layers in Annexes II-IV,
[loweralpha]
.. the placeholder <CodeListValue> shall represent the values of the relevant code list, with the first letter in upper case,
.. the placeholder <human-readable name> shall represent the human-readable name of the code list values;
.. the spatial object type shall include the relevant attribute and code list, in parentheses;
.. one example of a layer shall be given.

== Abstract Test Suite - (normative) 

[cols="", options="header"]
|===
*Disclaimer*

While this Annex refers to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services, it does not replace the legal act or any part of it.
|===

The objective of the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) included in this Annex is to help the conformance testing process. It includes a set of tests to be applied on a data set to evaluate whether it fulfils the requirements included in this data specification and the corresponding parts of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010 (implementing rule as regards interoperability of spatial datasets and services, further referred to as ISDSS Regulation). This is to help data providers in declaring the conformity of a data set to the "degree of conformity, with implementing rules adopted under Article 7(1) of Directive 2007/2/EC", which is required to be provided in the data set metadata according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2008/1205 (the Metadata Regulation).

*Part 1* of this ATS includes tests that provide *input for assessing conformity with the ISDSS regulation.* In order to make visible which requirements are addressed by a specific test, references to the corresponding articles of the legal act are given. The way how the cited requirements apply to mr specification is described under the testing method.

In addition to the requirements included in ISDSS Regulation this Technical guideline contains TG requirements too. TG requirements are technical provisions that need to be fulfilled in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement when the specific technical implementation proposed in this document is used. Such requirements relate for example to the default encoding described in section 9. *Part 2* of the ATS presents tests necessary for assessing the *conformity with TG requirements*.

NOTE Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in this ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

The *ATS is applicable to the data sets that* *have been transformed* to be made available through INSPIRE download services (i.e. the data returned as a response to the mandatory "Get Spatial Dataset" operation) rather than the original "source" data sets.

The requirements to be tested are grouped in several _conformance classes_. Each of these classes covers a specific aspect: one conformance class contains tests reflecting the requirements on the application schema, another on the reference systems, etc. *Each conformance class is identified by a URI* (uniform resource identifier) according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/mr/<conformance class identifier>

EXAMPLE 1 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ef/rs_ identifies the Reference Systems ISDSS conformance class of the Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF) data theme.

The results of the tests should be published referring to the relevant conformance class (using its URI).

When an INSPIRE data specification contains *more than one application schema,* the requirements tested in a conformance class may differ depending on the application schema used as a target for the transformation of the data set. This will always be the case for the application schema conformance class. However, also other conformance classes could have different requirements for different application schemas. In such cases, a separate conformance class is defined for each application schema, and they are distinguished by specific URIs according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/mr/<conformance class identifier>/ 
<application schema namespace prefix>

EXAMPLE 2 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/el/as/el-vec_ identifies the conformity with the application schema (_as_) conformance class for the Elevation Vector Elements (_el-vec_) application schema.

An overview of the conformance classes and the associated tests is given in the table below.

In order to be conformant to a conformance class, a data set has to pass *all* tests defined for that conformance class.

In order to be conformant with the ISDSS regulation the inspected data set needs to be conformant to *all* conformance classes in Part 1. The conformance class for overall conformity with the ISDSS regulation is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/mr/._

In order to be conformant with the Technical Guidelines, the dataset under inspection needs to be conformant to all conformance classes included both in Part 1 and 2. Chapter 8 describes in detail how to publish the result of testing regarding overall conformity and conformity with the conformance classes as metadata. The conformance class for overall conformity with the Technical Guidelines is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/tg/mr/3.0 rc3._

It should be noted that data providers are not obliged to integrate / decompose the original structure of the source data sets when they deliver them for INSPIRE. It means that a conformant dataset can contain less or more spatial object / data types than specified in the ISDSS Regulation.

*A dataset that contains less spatial object and/or data types* can be regarded conformant when the corresponding types of the source datasets after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation.

A *dataset that contain more spatial object and/or data types* may be regarded as conformant when

* all the spatial object / data types that have corresponding types in the source dataset after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation and
* all additional elements of the source model (spatial object types, data types, attributes, constraints, code lists and enumerations together with their values) do not conflict with any rule defined in the interoperability target specifications defined for any theme within INSPIRE.

====
*Open issue 1:* Even though the last condition can be derived from Art. 8(4) of the Directive, the ISDSS Regulation does not contain requirements concerning the above issue. Therefore, no specific tests have been included in this abstract suite for testing conformity of extended application schemas. Annex F of the Generic Conceptual Model (D2.5) provides an example how to extend INSPIRE application schemas in a compliant way.
====

The ATS contains a detailed list of abstract tests. It should be noted that some tests in the Application schema conformance class can be automated by utilising xml *schema validation tools.* It should be noted that failing such validation test does not necessary reflect non-compliance to the application schema; it may be the results of erroneous encoding.

Each test in this suite follows the same structure:

* Requirement: citation from the legal texts (ISDSS requirements) or the Technical Guidelines (TG requirements);
* Purpose: definition of the scope of the test;
* Reference: link to any material that may be useful during the test;
* Test method: description of the testing procedure.

According to ISO 19105:2000 all tests in this ATS are basic tests. Therefore, this statement is not repeated each time.

In order to properly evaluate the potential of the region and understand to which geological/geodynamic event(s) gold is related, the user will need to obtain information on (i) past production, reserves and resources, (ii) the metallogenic type of the deposit, (iii) its age, (iv) the host rock formation name, (v) the host rock type, and (vi) the host rock age. These last three data have to be extracted from the "Mineral deposit" database and not from the geological map used as background. The reason is that the host rock may cover a very small surface and thus not be represented on the geological background, depending of the scale/accuracy of this one. It is also possible that the host rock does not outcrop, and thus is not mapped.
|Pre-condition |Mineral resources data are available in line with INSPIRE specifications. A specific vocabulary related to the user requirements is available with a "mapping" between geological /metallogenic/mining terms and user's terms done by the data provider.
|Post-condition a|
The output should be detailed mineral resources data sets, exploration history, source of calculation methods, etc.. All given information should be delivered in an acceptable quality standard and multilingual.

The user has a listing and a map of selected deposits

*Requirements from the use case*

Analysing the use case, there is a need to provide the following objects and attributes:

Mineral deposits with:

* ID
* (Entry date)
* (Revision date)
* Name
* Country
* (Exploration history)
* Main commodity
* Secondary commodity
* Past production, reserves and resources
* (Standard according which the resources and reserves are calculated)
* (Source of resources and reserves data)
* Metallogenic type of the deposit
* Age of the deposit
* Host rock formation name
* Host rock type
* Host rock age

*Relationship with other INSPIRE Themes*

This use case has some relationships with the following INSPIRE data themes:

* Protected sites: to open or to expand a quarry to extract building material it is mandatory to take into account Protected Sites
* Population distribution - demography: to know the future needs for building material a simple rule is to know the number of inhabitants
* Transport networks: the distance between production and consumption areas, and the road network capacity and constraints are very important to know.

=== Ge in Europe: where to find it?

This use case is related to example of use:

* MR-01: Mineral exploration.

*Overview and involved actors*

Ge (Germanium) is one of the 14 commodities listed by EU as critical (*The raw materials initiative - Critical raw materials for the EU.* Report of the Ad-hoc Working Group on defining critical raw materials). Answering the question "Where is Ge in Europe?" and the combined question "Is there any potential for Ge in Europe?" is of interest for several actors, including EU authorities, geological surveys and mining agencies, academics, and also the general public.

The same question can be asked for several other strategic, critical, high-tech, or green commodities.

*Narrative description*

Answering the question "Where is Ge in Europe?",implies to get information on both ancient mines for their wastes and on deposits currently exploited. Information on mineralogy (e.g., presence of Ge minerals, presence of low-iron sphalerite and other sulphur minerals known to be significant Ge sources in some deposits [enargite, bornite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, luzonite, sulvanite and colusite]) can also be important as it can help to identify deposits/occurrences where Ge, not yet identified, could be present.

Ge is most of the time a by-product or a secondary commodity (exception: Noailhac Saint-Salvy, France, where Ge is one of the two main commodities with Zn). For answering the question, the user will need to obtain information on (1) deposits: (i) status, (ii) past production, reserves and resources, (iii) the metallogenic type of the deposit, (iv) the mineralogy of the ore, (v) the host rock formation name, (vi) the host rock type, and (2) on mining wastes (mainly for ancient/abandoned mines) with: (i) the type of processing, (ii) the type of waste, (iii) the mineralogy of waste and (iv) the characterization of waste (volume, tonnage, grade).

=== A manufacturer looking for GCC?

This use case is related to example of use:

* MR-01: Mineral exploration.

*Overview and involved actors*

This use case is dealing with Industrial Minerals and Rocks. A manufacturer is looking for the closest producers of Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC), allowing elaborating filler for the paper industry.

*Narrative description*

Ground Calcium Carbonate is used as filler mainly in the paper industry. More precisely, the user is looking for specific quality of GCC allowing elaborating coating. Geologically speaking, GCC correspond to white limestones. Such limestones have very distinct properties compared to all other limestones used in the industry (aggregates, lime, fertilizer, fluxing agent, etc.). Required physical properties are very precise:

* Whiteness: 88 to 96 %;
* Yellowness: 1.5 to 3 (no unit, it's a ratio);
* Aspect ratio: 10 m^2^/g;

Abrasivity: 4 mg.

=== Environmental uncertainties related to mining wastes

This use case is related to example of use:

* MR-01: Mineral exploration.

*Overview and involved actors*

This use case is strongly linked with the *DIRECTIVE 2006/21/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 March 2006 on the management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC.* The document gives a clear definition of wastes from the extractives industries: tailings (i.e. the waste solids or slurries that remain after the treatment of minerals by a number of techniques), waste rock and overburden (i.e. the material that extractive operations move during the process of accessing an ore or mineral body, including during the pre-production development stage), and topsoil (i.e. the upper layer of the ground) provided that they constitute waste as defined in Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste.

In order to prevent major accidents, it is particularly important to get a precise idea both of the mineralogical composition of the ore and the presence of potentially harmful elements (e.g., As, Hg, Cd, Se, Ni, etc.) and of the type of processing and thus the products which were used. The mineralogical composition of the ore is important because the wastes may contain low grade mineralization.

Getting this information is of interest for several actors, including Regional authorities, environmental agencies, and also the general public.

*Narrative description*

In several mining countries and regions, mining wastes from ancient exploitations are more or less abandoned, without any real or efficient protection perimeter. Most of the time they were located in the countryside, surrounded by acres of grassland. However, population increase and the development of urban zones may seriously modify land use and strongly reduce the distance between the wastes and centers of human activity. In such cases, it becomes urgent to evaluate 'the risk' for the population to live close to these anthropogenic concentrations.

For answering the question, the user will need to obtain information on (1) deposits: (i) name, (ii) main commodity, (iii) secondary commodities, (iv) the mineralogy of the ore, (v) harmful constituents, (2) on mining wastes with: (i) name, (ii) the type of processing, (iii) the type of waste, (iv) the mineralogy of waste and (v) the characterization of waste (volume, tonnage, grade â€“ *per element/commodity*), and (3) environmental impacts already noticed (with - ideally - *per environmental impact*: a) pathways: type of environmental pathways, b) receptors: type of environmental receptors, c) water treatment: management and treatment processes and structures of water and d) restoration: description of restoration used).

!Definition: !Ore sorting refers to the process of separating an ore into separate constituent parts. Today, ore sorters are widely used in industrial mineral mines, diamond mines and base and precious metal mines. Ores are typically sorted to increase the efficiency of other ore dressing and refining processes, by reducing the amount of material to be processed while simultaneously increasing its purity. Modern, automated sorting applies optical sensors (visible spectrum, near infrared, X-ray, ultraviolet), that can be coupled with electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility sensors, to control the mechanical separation of ore into two or more categories.

The effect of such currents is to induce a secondary magnetic field around the non-ferrous particle. This field reacts with the magnetic field of the rotor, resulting in a combined driving and repelling force which literally ejects the conducted particle from the stream of mixed materials. This repulsion force in combination with the product belt speed and the optimization of the product splitter plate provides the means for an effective separation.

*evaporationDrying*

[%autowidth]
!===
!Name: !Evaporation - drying
!Definition: !Drying is thermal removal of liquid moisture (not chemically bound) from a material. Drying is usually accomplished by contacting the moist solids with hot combustion gases generated by burning fossil fuels. In some cases, heat for drying can be provided by hot air or inert gas that has been indirectly heated. The amount of heat required for a given drying operation corresponds to the heat required to vaporize the liquid moisture, the heat required to raise the temperature of the products (dry solids and water vapor) to the final drying temperature, and heat required to offset radiant heat losses. Usually the drying temperature is set at a nominal value above the boiling point of water, often about 120?C. In special cases, such as in the drying of certain water-soluble salts, higher drying temperatures are required. In salt drying, the feed moisture is saturated with dissolved salts, which alters the boiling point and requires higher drying temperatures. Drying of moist solids is carried out in several types of industrial dryers, including rotary dryers, fluidized bed dryers, and flash dryers. Another type of drying, called spray drying, is carried out when the material to be dried is completely dissolved in aqueous solution. The solution is sprayed (usually through a specially designed nozzle) into a heated chamber and as the water is evaporated, solids crystallize. The water vapor is exhausted from the dryer, and dry solids are collected, usually in a conical section of the dryer. Solid material produced from a spray dryer often has special particle size and shape characteristics, which may be controlled by the concentration of dissolved material in the solution, and the design of the atomizing spray nozzle.

[%autowidth]

!Name: !Smelting
!Definition: !Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy; its main use is to produce a metal from its ore. Smelting involves thermal reactions in which at least one product is a molten phase. Metal oxides can then be smelted by heating with coke or charcoal (forms of carbon), a reducing agent that liberates the oxygen as carbon dioxide leaving a refined mineral. Carbonate ores are also smelted with charcoal, but are sometimes need to be calcined first. Other materials may need to be added as flux, aiding the melting of the oxide ores and assisting in the formation of a slag, as the flux reacts with impurities, such as silicon compounds. Smelting usually takes place at a temperature above the melting point of the metal, but processes vary considerably according to the ore involved and other matters.

*burning*

[%autowidth]
!===
!Name: !Burning
!Definition: !The utilization of coal-oil agglomerates in the recovery of gold is based on the natural hydrophobicity/oleophilicity of gold, a property which according to the consensus of most surface chemistry experts is brought about by the ease by which gold surface becomes contaminated, though is possible to recover gold by agglomerating them with oil, the amount of gold in the ore is usually small that there is insufficient gold particles to form agglomerates. Thus, the need to use other hydrophobic materials (e.g. coal) to either form agglomerates together with gold or act as a carrier of gold particles. Agglomerates are prepared in a previous step and then added to the ore pulp in a second step. The gold particles, being oilfilic, penetrate into the agglomerates. In a continuous operation the agglomerates would be maintained in contacting tanks until they reach a pre-determined gold content. The tailings are discarded by means of a screen situated at the upper part of the tanks. The recovery of gold from agglomerates is obtained in a later step by burning the agglomerates and then separating the gold from the ashes.

The data specification for _Mineral Resources_ (MR) is based closely on the EarthResourceML v2 (_http://www.earthresourceml.org/_) model that describes Earth Resources independent of associated human activities, permitting description using mineral deposit models encompassing internationally recognised deposit classifications, mineral systems and processes. EarthResourceML v1 was developed by the Australian Chief Government Geologists Committee (CCGC) but is now under the governance of the Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI), a commission of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), which has developed EarthResourceML v2.

The current version of the EarthResourceML â€“ v 2.0 integrates all the classes of the INSPIRE MR core data model. However the unique encoding solution to fully address both INSPIRE and EarthResourceML requirements still needs to be tested by the wider stakeholder community as part of the INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation Framework. Based on the results, it should be discussed whether the current default INSPIRE encoding (see Section 9.3.1.) can be replaced by the EarthResourceML encoding. More information on the use of EarthResourceML for INSPIRE is at:

_http://www.earthresourceml.org_.

=== Mineral Resources Extension 

In this Section the conceptual extension of the scope of the INSPIRE MR core data model is described. This model demonstrates the extensibility of the MR core data model (MineralResources) to meet additional requirements e.g. the Raw Materials Initiative and the Mining Waste Directive, both of which are described in Annex E.

NOTE *_For this conceptual extension the use of GeoSciML v3.2 is required. In order to make this extension fully INSPIRE-based further work as well as testing by the wider stakeholder community in the framework of the INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation is needed._*

The following types/attributes describe *Mining Waste* and Mining Waste Measure:

* Waste type;
* Material;
* Storage type;
* Waste measures (density, grade per commodity, volume);
* Environmental Impact.

The following types/attributes describe *Products:*

* Product;
* Grade;
* Production;
* Recovery.

The following types/attributes describe *Mined Material:*

* Material;
* Raw Material Role;
* Proportion.

The following types/attributes describe the *composition* of the Earth Resource with Earth Resource

Material:

* Material as Earth Material utilizing the GeoSciML v3.2 definition.
* Proportion of the material in the earth resource
* Role of the material described (host rock, alteration product, ...)

The MineralResourcesExtension model uses classes from the GeoSciML v3.2 EarthMaterial and PhysicalProperties packages.

* Inventory and *characterization of mining wastes*. Mining wastes and tailings represent a considerable potential source for strategic (high-tech, green, critical) commodities. Such commodities have not been taken into consideration by former exploitations for several reasons such as the lack of use of these commodities at that time, the lack of efficient industrial process for their recovery, or their cost. Locating and characterizing (industrial process used, grade, volume, etc.) these wastes is important and addresses EC questions about their recycling.
* Industrial minerals and rocks: besides the need for particular parameters for a proper description such as geological properties, mechanical behaviour, quality aspects, usage, some other parameters are required like commercial varieties and names.
* Importance of mineralogy for properly describing the ore, the gangue and hydrothermal alterations. Mineralogy data are for example of primordial importance when querying a database on the high-tech metal potential of certain deposits where they have not yet been identified.

==== Summary

In the MineralResourcesExtension schema there are additional Earth Resource classes: _MiningWaste and MiningWasteMeasure, MinedMaterial and Product and MineralSystem, SupergeneProcesses,_ and _EarthResourceMaterial._

==== Mine Extension: Mining Waste, Product and Mined material

[.text-center]
*Figure 6 â€“ UML class diagram: Mine Extension (Mining Waste, Product and Mined material)*

_MiningWaste_ is added as another type of _MiningFeature._ Mining waste can be defined as a part of the materials that result from the exploration, mining and processing of substances governed by legislation on mines and quarries.

The _producedMaterial_ association from _MiningActivity_ to _Product_ allows the type and amount of end-use products associated with a Mining Activity to be described.

The _sourceCommodity_ association from _Product_ to _Commodity_ describes the Commodity that was used to create the end-use Product.

The _rawMaterial_ association from _MiningActivity_ to _MinedMaterial_ allows the description of the raw materials of a Mining Activity. The Raw Material can be composed of one or more Mined Materials.

==== EarthResource material, mineral system, and supergene process

*Figure 7 â€“ UML class diagram: Earth Resource material*

The _geneticDescription_ association from _EarthResource_ to _MineralSystem_ allows all geological features that control the generation and preservation of the mineral deposits associated with the Earth Resource to be described.

The _supergeneModification_ association from _EarthResource_ to _SupergeneProcesses_ allows the description of the metal enrichment produced by the chemical remobilisation of elements in an oxidised or transitional environment, if this has occurred.

The _composition_ association from _EarthResource_ to _EarthResourceMaterial_ allows the material of economic interest found in the earth, or produced from the earth, to be described. The Earth Resource can be composed of one or more Earth Resource Materials.

*Figure 8 â€“ UML class diagram: Earth Material*

The MineralResourcesExtension application schema uses _EarthMaterial_ from GeoSciML to allow a full description of rock and mineral materials. The figure illustrates the use of _EarthMaterial_ in the application schema.

_EarthMaterial_ is an abstract class which holds a description of a naturally occurring substance in the Earth. Earth Material represents material composition or substance, and is thus independent of quantity or location. Ideally, Earth Materials are defined strictly based on physical properties, but because of standard geological usage, genetic interpretations may enter into the description as well. _EarthMaterial_ has two properties:

* Purpose: Specification of the intended purpose/level of abstraction for the given EarthMaterial.
* Color: Terms to specify color of the earth material. Color schemes such as the Munsell rock and soil color schemes could be used

The _physicalProperty_ association from _EarthMaterial_ to _PhysicalDescription_ allows the description of any of the numeric physical properties of the Earth Material (eg; density, porosity, magnetic susceptibility, remanent magnetism). _PhysicalDescription_ has two properties:

* Property Name: A term from a controlled vocabulary of physical properties of Earth Materials (eg; density, porosity, magnetic susceptibility, remanent magnetism, permeability, seismic velocity)
* Property Measure: A scalar or vector measurement of the physical property of an Earth Material

_EarthMaterial_ has two sub-types which are relevant to _Mineral Resources_, _CompoundMaterial_ and _Mineral_.

_Mineral_ is defined as any naturally occurring inorganic element or compound having a periodically repeating arrangement of atoms and a characteristic chemical composition or range of compositions, resulting in distinctive physical properties. Includes mercury as a general exception to the requirement of crystallinity. Also includes crypto-crystalline materials such as chalcedony and amorphous silica. Mineral has one property:

* Mineral Name: Name of the mineral (eg: orthoclase) or mineral family (eg: feldspar), approved by the International Mineralogical Association. (eg: http://www.mindat.org/mineralindex.php)

_CompoundMaterial_ is an Earth Material composed of particles composed of other Earth Materials, possibly including other Compound Materials. _CompoundMaterial_ has two properties:

* Composition Category: Term to specify the gross compositional character of a compound material. Composition as used here is loosely construed to include both chemical composition and petrograpic composition, thus multiple values may be applied to a single rock, e.g. metaluminous and alkalic, undersaturated and basic, etc. Terms would typically include broad chemical classifications such as silicate, carbonate, ferromagnesian, oxide. However, this attribute may have different terminology for different kinds of rocks - for example sandstone petrographic classification terms
* Genetic Category: A term that represents a summary geologic history of the material (ie, a genetic process classifier term). Examples include igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, shock metamorphic, volcanic, pyroclastic

In the _Mineral Resources_ data model the only type of _CompoundMaterial_ included is _RockMaterial_, and it is expected that most Earth Material descriptions will be given in terms of _RockMaterial_. _RockMaterial_ is a specialized _CompoundMaterial_ that includes consolidated and unconsolidated materials as well as mixtures of consolidated and unconsolidated materials. It has two properties:

* Consolidation Degree: A property that specifies the degree to which an aggregation of EarthMaterial particles is a distinct solid material. Consolidation and induration are related concepts specified by this property. They define a continuum from unconsolidated material to very hard rock. Induration is the degree to which a consolidated material is made hard, operationally determined by how difficult it is to break a piece of the material. Consolidated materials may have varying degrees of induration
* Lithology: A controlled concept indicating the name of the RockMaterial type (eg, quartz sandstone, basalt, muscovite schist, sand, mud, soil, saprolite)

The _alterationProperties_ association from _RockMaterial_ to _AlterationDescription_ allows the description of any alteration that the Rock Material has undergone. _AlterationDescription_ has four properties:

* Alteration Type: a general description of the dominant alteration mineralogy or alteration type, in common usage. Examples include: argillic, phyllic, potassic, propylitic, calc-silicate, skarn, deuteric, greisen, serpenitisation, weathering, etc
* Alteration Degree: a term to specify degree of modification from original material, (eg: weak, moderate, strong, intense)
* Alteration Product: the material result of alteration processes, e.g. alteration minerals, saprolite, ferricrete, clay, calcrete, skarn, etc. Materials observed in a soil profile could be identified using this property.
* Alteration Distribution: the spatial distribution or geometry of alteration zones, eg: patchy, spotted, banded, veins, vein breccia, pervasive, disseminated, etc

== Analysis of related legislation - (informative)

Several directives, communications or documents published by the European Commission are concerned with or refer to mineral resources:

=== The raw materials initiative (2008)

*The raw materials initiative â€” Meeting our critical needs for growth and jobs in Europe* \{SEC(2008) 2741}. Communication COM(2008) 699. (text underlined in grey is of particular interest for INSPIRE)

In this document, the Commission notices that there has been no integrated policy response at EU level up to now to ensure that it has sufficient access to raw materials at fair and undistorted prices. It is proposed that the EU should agree on an integrated raw materials strategy. Such a strategy should be based on the following 3 pillars:

. ensure *access to raw materials* from international markets under the same conditions as other industrial competitors;
. set the right *framework conditions* within the EU in order to foster sustainable supply of raw materials from European sources;
. boost overall resource efficiency and promote recycling to *reduce the EU's consumption of primary raw materials* and decrease the relative import dependence.

Two points are of particular interest for INSPIRE:

. The sustainable supply of raw materials based in the EU requires that *the knowledge base* of mineral deposits within the EU will be improved. In addition, the long term access to these deposits should be taken into account in land use planning. Therefore the Commission recommends that the national *geological surveys* become more actively involved in land use planning within the Member States.
. The Commission recommends better networking between the national geological surveys to facilitate the exchange of information and improve the interoperability of data and their dissemination, with particular attention to the needs of SMEs.


The document also stresses on the fact that the EU is highly dependent on imports of _"high-tech" metals_ such as cobalt, platinum, rare earths, and titanium. Though often needed only in tiny quantities, these metals are increasingly essential to the development of technologically sophisticated products in view of the growing number of their functionalities. These metals play a critical role in the development of innovative "environmental technologies" for boosting energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. *It is worth knowing that these _"high-tech" metals_ generally appear as secondary commodities in a deposit and that they may be present in mining wastes, tailings, smelter residues, etc., i.e. anthropogenic concentrations s.l.*

Furthermore, the Commission recommends that an integrated European strategy should, as a priority action, define critical raw materials for the EU.

*The raw materials initiative - Critical raw materials for the EU.* Report of the Ad-hoc Working Group on defining critical raw materials.

Although raw materials are essential for the EU economy, their availability is increasingly under pressure. Within the framework of the EU Raw Materials Initiative, it was decided to identify a list of critical raw materials at EU level, in close cooperation with Member States and stakeholders.

This report analyses a selection of 41 minerals and metals. In line with other studies, the report puts forward a *relative concept of criticality*. This means that raw material is labelled "critical" when the risks for supply shortage and their impacts on the economy are higher compared with most of the other raw materials. *Two types of risks* are considered: a) the *"supply risk"* taking into account the political-economic stability of the producing countries, the level of concentration of production, the potential for substitution and the recycling rate; and b) the *"environmental country risk"* assessing the risks that measures might be taken by countries with weak environmental performance in order to protect the environment and, in doing so, jeopardise the supply of raw materials to the EU. Building on existing approaches, this report sets out an innovative and pragmatic approach to determining criticality. In particular,

* It takes into *account the substitutability between materials*, i.e. the potential for substitution of a restricted raw material by another that does not face similar restrictions.
* It deals with *primary and secondary raw materials*, the latter being considered as similar to an indigenous European resource.
* It introduces a logical way to aggregate indicators and makes use of widely recognised indexes.
* It presents a transparent methodology.

Due to their high relative economic importance and to high relative supply risk, the Group has established a *list of 14 critical raw materials at EU level* (in alphabetical order):

[width="100%",cols="51%,49%"]
|===
|Antimony |Indium
|Beryllium |Magnesium
|Cobalt |Niobium
|Fluorspar |PGMs (Platinum Group Metals)
|Gallium |Rare earths
|Germanium |Tantalum
|Graphite |Tungsten
|===

Among the various recommendations made by the Group, one shall retain more particularly the following points:

* improving the availability of reliable, *consistent statistical information* in relation to raw materials;
* promoting the dissemination of this information, notably by preparing a *European Raw Materials Yearbook* with the involvement of national geological surveys and mining/processing industries. It should in particular aim at improving the knowledge on the availability of resources and on their flow into products through the value-added chains of the EU economies;
* establishing indicators of *competition to land* in the Member States.

The Group recommends *policy actions* to improve *access to primary resources* aiming at:

* supporting the findings and recommendations resulting from the work carried out by the ad hoc working group on "Best practices in the area of land use planning and permitting" with the view to *securing better access to land*, fair treatment of extraction with other competing land uses and more streamlined permitting processes;
* *promoting exploration*, and ensuring that exploration by companies is regarded as research activities;
* *promoting research on mineral processing*, extraction from old mine dumps, mineral extraction from deep deposits, and mineral exploration in general, notably under EU RTD Framework Programmes.

*The raw materials initiative - Actions 6 & 7. Improving framework conditions for extracting minerals from the EU. Exchanging best practice on land use planning, permitting and geological knowledge sharing*

The work detailed in this report has been undertaken with regards to actions 6 and 7 of the Raw Materials Initiative, linked to the second pillar of the Initiative (Set the right *framework conditions* within the EU in order to foster sustainable supply of raw materials from European sources). Action 6 involves identifying actions to promote the exchange of best practices in the area of land use planning and administrative conditions for exploration and extraction. Action 7 involves better networking between national Geological Surveys with the aim of increasing the EU's know ledge base, and looking into the need to develop a medium to long term strategy for integrating sub-surface components into land services of the GMES Land Monitoring Core Service.

*Recommendations of the working group* (text underlined in grey is of particular interest for INSPIRE)

The group recommends a *National Minerals Policy* to ensure that the mineral resources are provided to society in an economically viable way, harmonised with other national policies, based on sustainable developments principles and including a commitment to provide a legal and information framework.

The *Minerals Planning Policy* is seen as key component of the national minerals policy. It should describe in detail the ways that future minerals supply will be secured and demonstrate a strong link to broader land use planning policy and regulation.

A *Sustainable Minerals Policy* shall be based on the principles of sustainable development and incorporate economic, environmental and social requirements.

Any land use policy for minerals must utilise a robust digital geological knowledge base ensuring fair and equal consideration of all potential uses of land including the eventual extraction of raw materials. Alongside information on the resource of local importance, a method for estimating the long term demand for these materials, and a means by which this can be translated into a spatial plan while recognising the contribution of recycled materials a needed.

The most important elements of the minerals exploration and extraction application process are: *clarity, understanding* and *certainty* of what needs to be provided in order to get authorisation for minerals exploration or extraction.

This can take the shape of a standardised application form or could be set out in legislation or guidance.

Speeding up the authorisation processes may be achieved through integrating the different permits required so that they are issued by one competent authority (a one -stop-shop) and with only one environmental impact assessment or by parallel assessment.

Codes of practice are important instruments to achieve *technical, social and environmental excellence*. Use of codes of practice, guidelines or equivalent by industry helps to ensure protection of the environment from adverse impacts of mineral extraction.

To improve the knowledge base of mineral deposits in the EU the need harmonised EU level data sets stands out. Better networking between the national Geological Surveys of Member States is the basis for cooperation between relevant institutions and the Geological Survey and driven by the need to:

* achieve synergies between the Geological Surveys;
* provide public data for policy making;
* facilitate investment in exploration and extraction;
* provide minerals intelligence;
* the networking must be structured, organised, long -term oriented and consensus based.

*Standardised and accurate statistical data* on world wide minerals production, imports and exports, and publication of this data on an annual basis. This would serve to analyse trends and help decision makers to better understand and monitor the EU's supply and demand situation and related risks.

GMES will provide parts of the needed satellite data for e.g. ground stability monitoring which could be processed into directly useful information for RMI by national institutes or value-adding industry in the Member States. Alternatively, GMES could also potentially directly provide such services while requiring an assessment of whether respecting the principle of subsidiarity, of costs, benefits, political priorities etc.

Medium to long term projects should base on experience gained (e.g. ProMine project) to develop future '3D-Europe' projects while focussing at first on the areas with known mineral potential.

The development of a pan-European programme of deep scientific boreholes data acquisition, processing and modelling should be considered as an important component of Europe's scientific infrastructure.

=== The Mining Waste Directive

*DIRECTIVE 2006/21/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 March 2006 on the management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC*

The document reminds of decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme that sets as the objective for wastes that are still generated that the level of their hazardousness should be reduced and that they should present as little risk as possible, that preference should be given to recovery and especially to recycling, that the quantity of waste for disposal should be minimised and should be safely disposed of, and that waste intended for disposal should be treated as closely as possible to the place of its generation ... Decision No 1600/2002/EC also sets as a priority action the promotion of sustainable management of extractive industries with a view to reducing their environmental impact.

The document also gives a clear definition of wastes from the extractives industries: tailings (i.e. the waste solids or slurries that remain after the treatment of minerals by a number of techniques), waste rock and overburden (i.e. the material that extractive operations move during the process of accessing an ore or mineral body, including during the pre-production development stage), and topsoil (i.e. the upper layer of the ground) provided that they constitute waste as defined in Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste.

In article 5 "Waste management plan", it is clearly said that the objectives of the waste management plan shall be (among other) to encourage the recovery of extractive waste by means of recycling, reusing or reclaiming such waste, where this is environmentally sound in accordance with existing environmental standards at Community level and with the requirements of this Directive where relevant. *This point is particularly important because such wastes may contain _"high-tech / strategic metals"_. These wastes may represent under certain favourable conditions (volume, grade, ...) not insignificant resources and thus might contribute to reduce the European deficit in these commodities.*

Annex II of the document deals with waste characterisation, and brings useful indications on how a "Mining waste" database should be structured:

The waste to be deposited in a facility shall be characterised in such a way as to guarantee the longâ€‘term physical and chemical stability of the structure of the facility and to prevent major accidents. The waste characterisation shall include, where appropriate and in accordance with the category of the waste facility, the following aspects:


. *description of expected physical and chemical characteristics of the waste to be deposited in the short and the long term*, with particular reference to its stability under surface atmospheric/meteorological conditions, *taking account of the type of mineral or minerals to be extracted and the nature of any overburden and/or gangue minerals that will be displaced in the course of the extractive operations*;
. classification of the waste according to the relevant entry in Decision 2000/532/EC, with particular regard to its hazardous characteristics;
. description of the chemical substances to be used during treatment of the mineral resource and their stability;
. description of the method of deposition;
. waste transport system to be employed.
