== How to read the document?

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Geographical Names – Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.1rc1 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _Geographical Names_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Geographical Names_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Geographical Names_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services – General Executive Summary

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services&#44;] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML – Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== Geographical Names – Executive Summary

Geographical names are included in Annex I of the Directive, which means that they are considered as reference data, i.e. data that constitute the spatial frame for recognising geographical location in general, as well as linking to and/or pointing at other information that belong to specific thematic fields such as environment, addresses, area management, human health and many others.

Geographical names are widely used in every-day communication for referring to various natural and man-made objects in the real world. Consequently they are interconnected with other themes in INSPIRE. Administrative units, addresses, elements of hydrography (lakes, rivers etc.), elements of transport networks (airports, bridges etc.) and protected sites are usually referred to by their names.

Geographical names are used extensively when searching for information in web-services (including geoportals), navigating, referencing thematic information to a location (geocoding), visualising geographic information on maps and screens, as well as when processing spatial data sets comprising historical data. Correct usage of geographical names is a principal aspect of everyday communication; consequently the status (official, historical...) linguistic properties (language, spelling, eventual transliteration, etc.) are a prime interest of many users, including press agencies, map publishers, spatial analysts, authorities, etc.

The INSPIRE data specification on geographical names has been prepared following the participative principle of a consensus building process. The stakeholders, based on their registration as a Spatial Data Interest Community (SDIC) or a Legally Mandated Organisation (LMO), had the opportunity to bring forward user requirements and reference materials, propose experts for the specification development, and to participate in reviewing and testing the data specifications. The Thematic Working Group responsible for the specification development of _Geographical names_ was composed of experts coming from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, and Spain. The specification process took place according to the methodology elaborated for INSPIRE respecting the requirements and the recommendation of the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model.

In everyday life, the same place can be referred to by several names. In order to reflect this approach the central element of the INSPIRE geographical names data model is the spatial object "named place" that can carry one or more names. The specifications of geographical names can be used for modelling names in any other INSPIRE theme.

Each named place has a unique INSPIRE identifier. It is further characterised by the eventual name(s), geometrical representation and if available, typefootnote:[Characterisation of the kind of entity designated by the geographical names according to the code list of INSPIRE. Whenever possible, types are taken from the INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary (administrative units, buildings, hydrography, land cover, transport network, protected sites) that are complemented by other frequently used types like elements of landforms and populated places. The not categorised types belong to the Other category.], local typefootnote:[Characterisation of the kind of entity as defined by the data provider.], indicative scale of usage, and the possibly related spatial objects. The latter helps to preserve consistency between data at different levels of detail. In addition, life-cycle informationfootnote:[When the named place has been inserted / changed, or eventually superseded / retired in the spatial data set] should be given if available.

Geographical names are proper nouns applied to real world entities. All names related to the same real world entity have to be provided with correct spelling. If available, further properties on the names are given, such as the language, the source and the statusfootnote:[official, standardised, historical, other] of the name, the scriptfootnote:[Set of graphic symbols employed in writing a particular name, like Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, etc.] used, and (when relevant) the transliterationfootnote:[Method of conversion between different scripts] scheme. A specific attribute describes if the name is an endonymfootnote:["Name of a spatial object in an official or well established language occurring in that area where the feature is situated." (from [UNGEGN Glossary 2007])] or exonymfootnote:["Name used in a specific language for a geographical feature situated outside the area where that language is widely spoken, and differing in its form from the respective endonym(s) in the area where the geographical feature is situated." (from [UNGEGN Glossary 2007])]. As part of linguistic information, the pronunciation of the name can be given either using the International Phonetic Alphabet, or linking the URIfootnote:[Unique Resource Identifier] of a sound file.

Interoperability is also supported by a common reference systemfootnote:[ETRS89 or (when applicable) ITRS] and provisions for visualisation. For the latter simple rules for default portrayal are given. The typefaces and fonts used for the portrayal of geographical names shall fully and correctly reproduce all the letters and diacritics/accents present in the spellings of the geographical names to be visualised.

The main value of the INSPIRE geographical names model is a simple yet flexible structure that allows geographical names to be used as an attribute of a spatial object, either modelled within the geographical names theme or in any other theme of INSPIRE. The possibility of linking more names with the same named places gives the opportunity to integrate minority languages and exonyms, which are an important contribution to European multilingualism.

As the specification on INSPIRE geographical names is the result of a detailed analysis of user requirements and involves strong consideration of existing initiativesfootnote:[For example UNGEGN and EuroGeoNames project] that go beyond the strictly environmental scope, it is expected that it will also be a solid element of a multi-purpose European spatial data infrastructure.

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Geographical Names_ as defined in Annex I of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

<<<
== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme Geographical Names.

=== Informal description

*[.underline]#Definition:#*

Names of areas, regions, localities, cities, suburbs, towns or settlements, or any geographical or topographical feature of public or historical interest. [Directive 2007/2/EC]

*[.underline]#Description:#*

This data specification describes concepts related with geographical names, i.e. proper nouns applied to a natural, man-made or cultural real world entity. The data specification is guided by the multi-language and multi-scriptual situation in Europe: a geographic entity can have different names in one or several languages, and each name can have different spellings, i.e. spellings in different scripts.

Because of this multi-language and multi-scriptual context, this specification defines a product that is feature oriented in order to enable to express which different names are used to designate one given place. In other words, the spatial objects defined in this specification are the 'named places', and the 'geographical names' are seen as information related to a named place. However, the product focuses on the description of names rather than the description of spatial objects: it particularly describes characteristics of names like their language and spellings in different scripts.

In some cases names can be applied as attributes of appropriately modelled spatial objects in other themes defined by INSPIRE. However, often the definition, classification, geometry and other attributes of these objects do not necessary correspond with the respective named places as defined by this data specification, which focuses on the names aspects. Besides, commonly named geographic entities such as elevations, islands or coastal land formations are seldom modelled as spatial objects in other themes, while they are modelled as named places in this specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

Any data set with information on geographical names may be published according to the _Geographical names_ specification. This is recommended in particular for Member States if no names data set exists, or where the other data sets complement the information from the names data sets. In the latter case, the data provider should ensure consistency as the data is published and, if possible, undertake action to integrate the data sources.

====

Geographical names serve as a means to identify locations. They may be used, together with appropriate information on the named entity, in different products like maps and gazetteers as well as respective services. _Gazetteers_ and gazetteer services associate the names with corresponding features – or locations – by means of co-ordinates, feature types and/or other necessary information. Among other needs, this data specification aims at answering to the need of a multi-lingual pan-European gazetteer (service) that shall most probably be established as a part of INSPIRE.

=== How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 1 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

*Figure 1 - Relationship between INSPIRE Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines*

==== Requirements

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Geographical Names_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme Geographical Names in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).
====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X* 

This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.
====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X* 

Recommendations are shown using this style.
====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

<<<
== Specification scopes

This data specification does not distinguish different specification scopes, but just considers one general scope.

NOTE For more information on specification scopes, see [ISO 19131:2007], clause 8 and Annex D.

<<<
== Identification information

These Technical Guidelines are identified by the following URI:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/tg/gn/3.1rc1

NOTE ISO 19131 suggests further identification information to be included in this section, e.g. the title, abstract or spatial representation type. The proposed items are already described in the document metadata, executive summary, overview description (section 2) and descriptions of the application schemas (section 5). In order to avoid redundancy, they are not repeated here.

<<<
== Data content and structure

=== Application schemas – Overview 

==== Application schemas included in the IRs

Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Implementing Rules lay down the requirements for the content and structure of the data sets related to the INSPIRE Annex themes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 4_
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme Geographical Names are defined in the following application schemas (see sections 5.3):

* Geographical Names application schema

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

NOTE The application schemas presented in this section contain some additional information that is not included in the Implementing Rules, in particular multiplicities of attributes and association roles.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 1*

Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the multiplicities defined for the attributes and association roles in this section.

====

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema – across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 5_
*Types*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.

. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 1 below.

[.text-center]
*Table 1 – Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[align=center,width="100%",cols="22%,14%,64%",options="header",]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The «voidable» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided – either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 2*

The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The «voidable» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the «voidable» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the «voidable» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=5]
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

. Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:
[loweralpha]
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;
.. code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 3*

Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.

. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 4*

Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows.
+
INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codeList/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codeList/<CodeListName__>/<value>.

* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined.
+
Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists.
+
The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:
+
** The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.
** The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".
** In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.
** The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones.

+
Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.


[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 5*

The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codeList/<UpperCamelCaseName>_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "\{complete,disjoint}".

==== Identifier management

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.

. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

====

NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier which is published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. [DS-D2.5]

NOTE 2 Article 9(1) is implemented in each application schema by including the attribute _inspireId_ of type Identifier.

NOTE 3 Article 9(2) is ensured if the _namespace_ and _localId_ attributes of the Identifier remains the same for different versions of a spatial object; the _version_ attribute can of course change.

==== Geometry representation

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_
*Other Requirements & Rules*

. The value domain of spatial properties defined in this Regulation shall be restricted to the Simple Feature spatial schema as defined in Herring, John R. (ed.), OpenGIS® Implementation Standard for Geographic information – Simple feature access – Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 10_
*Life-cycle of Spatial Objects*

(...)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where the attributes beginLifespanVersion and endLifespanVersion are used, the value of endLifespanVersion shall not be before the value of beginLifespanVersion.

====

NOTE The requirement expressed in the IR Requirement above will be included as constraints in the UML data models of all themes.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 6*

If life-cycle information is not maintained as part of the spatial data set, all spatial objects belonging to this data set should provide a void value with a reason of "unpopulated".

====

=== Application schema Geographical Names

==== Description

===== Narrative description and UML overview

[.underline]#Overview#:

The core of the _Geographical Names_ application schema is described in figure 1 that shows its non-voidable elements.

image::./media/image5.png[simpleView,width=374,height=201]

[.text-center]
*Figure 2 – UML class diagram: core of the _Geographical Names_ application schema*

The only feature type of the schema is the feature type _NamedPlace_, representing any real world entity referred to by one or several proper nouns.

Each _NamedPlace_ is associated with one or several geographical names, i.e. proper nouns applied to the spatial object, modelled with the data type _GeographicalName_. The different geographical names of one given spatial object may be for example the names in different languages or in different forms (e.g. complete and short forms of country and administrative unit names).

Each _GeographicalName_ may have one or several spellings, i.e. proper ways of writing it, in one or several scripts like the Latin/Roman, Greek and Cyrillic scripts, modelled with the data type _SpellingOfName._

For example:

* The city of Athens may be modelled in the schema as one NamedPlace.
* The endonym "Athína" (Greek language) and exonym "Athens" (English language) are two different GeographicalName of this unique NamedPlace.
* "Aθnνa" (Greek script) and its standard romanisation "Athína" (Latin script) are two different SpellingOfName of the same GeographicalName "Athína".

[.underline]#Narrative summary of individual classes:#

Figure 3 summarizes the _Geographical names_ application schema. More complete and precise definitions of the types and attributes are given in the following sections.

image::./media/image6.png[Geographical Names Overview,width=604,height=702]

[.text-center]
*Figure 3 – UML class diagram: Overview of the _Geographical Names_ application schema*

* One NamedPlace, representing any real world entity referred to by one or several proper nouns, is described by the following attributes:
** One _inspireId (non voidable)_, identifier of the spatial object.
** One or several _name(s)_ (non voidable)_,_ referring to the _NamedPlace._
** One _geometry_ (non voidable)_,_ describing the footprint or a reference point of the _NamedPlace._ The geometry may be any of the geometries defined by the Simple Feature Specification, including compound geometries.
** One or several _type(s),_ characterising the kind of entity represented by the _NamedPlace,_ chosen from a harmonised and high-level list of values.
** One or several _localType(s)_, which is a characterisation of the kind of feature represented by the _NamedPlace_, as defined by the data provider.
** From zero to several _relatedSpatialObject(s)_, which are the identifiers of spatial objects representing the same entity than the _NamedPlace_ but appearing in other themes of INSPIRE.
** One or zero _leastDetailedViewingResolution_ and zero or one _mostDetailedViewingResolution_, representing at which viewing scale the names should be displayed, and holding some information about the importance of the _NamedPlace_.
** One _beginLifespanVersion_ and zero or one _endLifespanVersion,_ representing when this version of the spatial object was inserted / changed / deleted / superseded in the spatial data set.
* One GeographicalName, representing a proper noun of the NamedPlace, is described by the following attributes:
** One or several _spelling(s)_ (non voidable), representing proper ways of writing the _GeographicalName_.
** One _language_, representing the language of the _GeographicalName_.
** One _nativeness_ (values _'endonym'_ or _'exonym'_), enabling to acknowledge if the name is the one that is/was used in the area where the feature is situated at the instant when the name is/was in use.
** One _nameStatus (values 'official', 'standardised', 'historical' or_ _'other')_, enabling to discern which credit should be given to the _GeographicalName_ with respect to its standardisation and/or its topicality.
** One _sourceOfName_, representing the (original) data source from which the geographical name is taken from (e.g. gazetteer, geographical names data set).
** One _pronunciation_, representing the proper, correct or standard pronunciation of the _GeographicalName_ expressed by means of text in the International Phonetic Alphabet, or with a link to an audio file, or both.
** Zero or one _grammaticalGender (values 'masculine', feminine, 'neuter' or 'common')_.
** Zero or one _grammaticalNumber (values 'singular', 'plural',_ or _'dual'_).
* One SpellingOfName, representing the proper way of writing a GeographicalName, is described by the following attributes:
** One _text_ (non voidable), which is the textual spelling itself.
** One _script_, representing the script in which the _Spelling_ is rendered.
** Zero or one _transliterationScheme_ defining the method used for the conversion of the spelling from one script to another.
* One PronunciationOfName, representing the proper way of pronouncing a GeographicalName, is described by at least one of the following attributes:
** Zero or one _pronunciationIPA_, for expressing the pronunciation in the International Phonetic Alphabet
** Zero or one _pronunciationSoundLink_, for expressing the pronunciation as a link to a sound file.

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

====== Consistency across borders 

[.underline]#Explanation of context and example#

Each Member State may provide geographical names associated to spatial objects, while some of these spatial objects do cross borders. The linkage of border-crossing spatial objects will be dealt within each data specification for the respective INSPIRE themes. However, for geographical names a special situation appears: the Member States are mainly responsible for providing the endonyms, whereas language communities take care of the collection of exonyms. Moreover, the mutual consent between the data providers of the Member States and the custodians of language groups are not yet established on a multi-lateral level.

The Danube river example illustrates the complexity of related geographical names issues for border-crossing spatial objects: Danube is a spatial entity crossing borders and associated with several names, endonyms as well as exonyms (see more detail in Annex D.7 or in [EGN D4.2e]). The number of endonyms mainly depends on the languages spoken in that area where the spatial object is situated.

* Endonyms appearing in the respective countries (in Member States data sets): Donau (Germany, Austria), Dunaj (Slovakia), Duna (Hungary), Dunav (Croatia), Dunav (Serbia), Dunav (Bulgaria), Dunărea (Romania), Dunărea (Moldova), Dunaj (Ukraine)
* Exonyms appearing in the respective languages (in exonyms database): Danube (English), Dunava (Serbian.), etc.

Insights for managing this can be found within the EuroGeoNames project where it has been decided that the participating National Mapping and Cadastral Agencies (NMCAs) do provide one "compiled" spatial object for each national part of the Danube river. The respective endonyms are then associated to each national part of the Danube river and linked together within the EuroGeoNames pan-European gazetteer service. In addition, the existing exonyms, which are not part of the databases of the NMCAs, are linked to all related (national) "compiled" spatial objects across Europe through a centralised database of exonyms being a supplement database to the EGN gazetteer service.

[.underline]#Guidance for consistency across national borders#

The correct relation of geographical names (endonyms and exonyms) with border-crossing spatial objects requires a solid understanding and experience of multi-lingual issues. Therefore, a coordinated approach on a European level should be preferred.

[.underline]#Note for cross-borders issues within national data sets#

The same situation reported here for cross-international borders may appear within one Member State, and then within one single data set following this specification. Indeed, some spatial objects may cross different language areas within one state. It is thus let to the data providers to decide which more significant spatial objects should be delivered for holding names according to the situation in each state (e.g. only one spatial object for a full river in a country, or one spatial object for each part of the river in an administrative/linguistic area, or one spatial object for each river section...).

====== Consistency between different INSPIRE themes

Geometry is the only information that can be used to find out in which administrative units a named place is located. However, this is very important information when using names, for example as a search criterion. Queries on intersections between geometries of named places and administrative units should thus certainly be important in a lot of use cases. As a consequence, a special care should be made on the consistency of geometries between the _Administrative units_ and _Geographical names_ INSPIRE spatial data themes. For example, if the geometry of a spatial object (e.g. populated place) is a reference point, this point should lie inside the footprint of the administrative unit (e.g. municipality) containing it when this is applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 7*

The geometry of the named places should be consistent with the geometry of administrative units depicted in the INSPIRE theme _Administrative units_.

====

Besides, the same spatial entity may be represented by different spatial objects in different INSPIRE themes, which raises the following recommendation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 8*

If a spatial entity is modelled as a _NamedPlace_ but also as other feature types defined in other INSPIRE themes, this multiple representation should be made explicit by populating the attribute _relatedSpatialObject_ of _Geographical names_, which contains the identifier of the other themes' spatial objects in question. This is particularly recommended when data providers store data once (e.g. one river) but publish data according to several INSPIRE data specifications (e.g. _Hydrography_ and _Geographical names_), as the information is then easily available.

====

====== Consistency across levels of detail

One single real world entity may appear in different local/national names data sets with different levels of detail. In this case, data providers could decide to deliver one or several spatial objects corresponding to the same real world entity in one compiled data set, or in several data sets, each one representing a certain level of detail.

This specification does not put any requirement on this issue: avoiding multiplicity of occurrences is the best way to avoid redundancies and inconsistencies; however in some situations different representations of the same spatial object may be useful to reflect different points of views. In any case, whatever the solution chosen by data providers, a special attention should be paid on consistency between levels of detail.

===== Modelling of object references

See Recommendation 8 in section 5.3.1.2.2 about _Consistency between different INSPIRE themes_.

===== Geometry representation

This data specification does not restrict the geometry types of _NamedPlace_ objects. The most common geometry types for a _NamedPlace_ are a reference point (of ISO type GM_Point) or a more precise geometry of the footprint (typically GM_Curve or GM_Surface). In addition, bounding boxes are also a common type of geometry in many names databases. Products defined by this specification should model bounding boxes with the ISO type GM_Surface (this specification does not allow for ISO type GM_Envelope).

See also Recommendation 7 in section 5.3.1.2.2 about _Consistency between different INSPIRE themes_.

NOTE 2 Even if this attribute is "voidable" for practical reasons linked to its availability in data sources, this information may be of first importance for viewing services. There are great chances that viewing services will inefficiently manage named places having this attribute void.

* Names of important cities in Europe may be displayed at all viewing scales greater than 1/5,000,000. In this case, the value of the attribute is 5,000,000

== Reference systems, units of measure and grids

=== Default reference systems, units of measure and grid

The reference systems, units of measure and geographic grid systems included in this sub-section are the defaults to be used for all INSPIRE data sets, unless theme-specific exceptions and/or additional requirements are defined in section 6.2.

==== Coordinate reference systems

===== Datum

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.2_
*Datum for three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems*

For the three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems and the horizontal component of compound coordinate reference systems used for making spatial data sets available, the datum shall be the datum of the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) in areas within its geographical scope, or the datum of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) or other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with ITRS in areas that are outside the geographical scope of ETRS89. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of the ITRS and there is a well documented relationship between both systems, according to EN ISO 19111.

====

===== Coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.3_
*Coordinate Reference Systems*

Spatial data sets shall be made available using at least one of the coordinate reference systems specified in sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, unless one of the conditions specified in section 1.3.4 holds.

*1.3.1. Three-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.
* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

*1.3.2. Two-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate reference system.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Transverse Mercator coordinate reference system.

*1.3.3. Compound Coordinate Reference Systems*

--
. For the horizontal component of the compound coordinate reference system, one of the coordinate reference systems specified in section 1.3.2 shall be used.

. For the vertical component, one of the following coordinate reference systems shall be used:
--

* For the vertical component on land, the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) shall be used to express gravity-related heights within its geographical scope. Other vertical reference systems related to the Earth gravity field shall be used to express gravity-related heights in areas that are outside the geographical scope of EVRS.
* For the vertical component in the free atmosphere, barometric pressure, converted to height using ISO 2533:1975 International Standard Atmosphere, or other linear or parametric reference systems shall be used. Where other parametric reference systems are used, these shall be described in an accessible reference using EN ISO 19111-2:2012.
* For the vertical component in marine areas where there is an appreciable tidal range (tidal waters), the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) shall be used as the reference surface.
* For the vertical component in marine areas without an appreciable tidal range, in open oceans and effectively in waters that are deeper than 200 meters, the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or a well-defined reference level close to the MSL shall be used as the reference surface.

*1.3.4. Other Coordinate Reference Systems*

Exceptions, where other coordinate reference systems than those listed in 1.3.1, 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 may be used, are:

. Other coordinate reference systems may be specified for specific spatial data themes in this Annex.

. For regions outside of continental Europe, Member States may define suitable coordinate reference systems.

The geodetic codes and parameters needed to describe these coordinate reference systems and to allow conversion and transformation operations shall be documented and an identifier shall be created, according to EN ISO 19111 and ISO 19127.

====

===== Display

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.4_
*Coordinate Reference Systems used in the View Network Service*

For the display of spatial data sets with the view network service as specified in Regulation No 976/2009, at least the coordinate reference systems for two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude) shall be available.

====

===== Identifiers for coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.5_
*Coordinate Reference System Identifiers*

. Coordinate reference system parameters and identifiers shall be managed in one or several common registers for coordinate reference systems.

. Only identifiers contained in a common register shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems listed in this Section.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to use the http URIs provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium as coordinate reference system identifiers (see identifiers for the default CRSs below). These are based on and redirect to the definition in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry (_http://www.epsg-registry.org/_).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 2*

The identifiers listed in Table 1 shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems used in a data set.

====

NOTE CRS identifiers may be used e.g. in:

* data encoding,
* data set and service metadata, and
* requests to INSPIRE network services.

*Temporal Reference Systems*

. The default temporal reference system referred to in point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (footnote:[OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12.]) shall be used, unless other temporal reference systems are specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE 1 Point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (the INSPIRE Metadata IRs) states that the default reference system shall be the Gregorian calendar, with dates expressed in accordance with ISO 8601.

NOTE 2 ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. The standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears first in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It also provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information across time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

EXAMPLE 1997 (the year 1997), 1997-07-16 (16^th^ July 1997), 1997-07-16T19:20:3001:00 (16^th^ July 1997, 19h 20' 30'', time zone: UTC1)

== Data quality

This chapter includes a description of the data quality elements and sub-elements as well as the corresponding data quality measures that should be used to evaluate and document data quality for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Geographical Names_ (section 7.1).

It may also define requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Geographical Names_ (sections 7.2 and 7.3).

In particular, the data quality elements, sub-elements and measures specified in section 7.1 should be used for

* evaluating and documenting data quality properties and constraints of spatial objects, where such properties or constraints are defined as part of the application schema(s) (see section 5);
* evaluating and documenting data quality metadata elements of spatial data sets (see section 8); and/or
* specifying requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Geographical Names_ (see sections 7.2 and 7.3).

The descriptions of the elements and measures are based on Annex D of ISO/DIS 19157 Geographic information – Data quality.

=== Data quality elements

Table 3 lists all data quality elements and sub-elements that are being used in this specification. Data quality information can be evaluated at level of spatial object, spatial object type, dataset or dataset series. The level at which the evaluation is performed is given in the "Evaluation Scope" column.

The measures to be used for each of the listed data quality sub-elements are defined in the following sub-sections.

== Dataset-level metadata

This section specifies dataset-level metadata elements, which should be used for documenting metadata for a complete dataset or dataset series.

NOTE Metadata can also be reported for each individual spatial object (spatial object-level metadata). Spatial object-level metadata is fully described in the application schema(s) (section 5).

For some dataset-level metadata elements, in particular those for reporting data quality and maintenance, a more specific scope can be specified. This allows the definition of metadata at sub-dataset level, e.g. separately for each spatial object type (see instructions for the relevant metadata element).

=== Metadata elements defined in INSPIRE Metadata Regulation

Table 1 gives an overview of the metadata elements specified in Regulation 1205/2008/EC (implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata).

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to the relevant section in the Metadata Regulation, which contains a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.
* The fourth column specifies the condition, under which the given element becomes mandatory.

Generic guidelines for implementing these elements using ISO 19115 and 19119 are available at _http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101_. The following sections describe additional theme-specific recommendations and requirements for implementing these elements.

==== Conformity

The _Conformity_ metadata element defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC requires to report the conformance with the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services. In addition, it may be used also to document the conformance to another specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 14*

Dataset metadata should include a statement on the overall conformance of the dataset with this data specification (i.e. conformance with all requirements).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 15*

The _Conformity_ metadata element should be used to document conformance with this data specification (as a whole), with a specific conformance class defined in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A and/or with another specification.

====

The _Conformity_ element includes two sub-elements, the _Specification_ (a citation of the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services or other specification), and the _Degree_ of conformity. The _Degree_ can be _Conformant_ (if the dataset is fully conformant with the cited specification), _Not Conformant_ (if the dataset does not conform to the cited specification) or _Not Evaluated_ (if the conformance has not been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 16*

If a dataset is not yet conformant with all requirements of this data specification, it is recommended to include information on the conformance with the individual conformance classes specified in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 17*

If a dataset is produced or transformed according to an external specification that includes specific quality assurance procedures, the conformity with this specification should be documented using the _Conformity_ metadata element.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 18*

If minimum data quality recommendations are defined then the statement on the conformity with these requirements should be included using the _Conformity_ metadata element and referring to the relevant data quality conformance class in the Abstract Test Suite.

====

NOTE Currently no minimum data quality requirements are included in the IRs. The recommendation above should be included as a requirement in the IRs if minimum data quality requirements are defined at some point in the future.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 19*

When documenting conformance with this data specification or one of the conformance classes defined in the Abstract Test Suite, the _Specification_ sub-element should be given using the http URI identifier of the conformance class or using a citation including the following elements:

* title: "INSPIRE Data Specification on Geographical Names – Draft Guidelines – <name of the conformance class>"
* date:
** dateType: publication
** date: yyyy-mm-dd

==== Lineage

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 20*

Following the ISO/DIS 19157 Quality principles, if a data provider has a procedure for the quality management of their spatial data sets then the appropriate data quality elements and measures defined in ISO/DIS 19157 should be used to evaluate and report (in the metadata) the results. If not, the _Lineage_ metadata element (defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC) should be used to describe the overall quality of a spatial data set.

====

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, lineage "is a statement on process history and/or overall quality of the spatial data set. Where appropriate it may include a statement whether the data set has been validated or quality assured, whether it is the official version (if multiple versions exist), and whether it has legal validity. The value domain of this metadata element is free text".

The Metadata Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119 specifies that the statement sub-element of LI_Lineage (EN ISO 19115) should be used to implement the lineage metadata element.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 21*

To describe the transformation steps and related source data, it is recommended to use the following sub-elements of LI_Lineage:

* For the description of the transformation process of the local to the common INSPIRE data structures, the LI_ProcessStep sub-element should be used.

* For the description of the source data the LI_Source sub-element should be used.

====

NOTE 1 In order to improve the interoperability, domain templates and instructions for using these free text elements (descriptive statements) may be specified here and/or in an Annex of this data specification.

==== Temporal reference

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, at least one of the following temporal reference metadata sub-elements shall be provided: temporal extent, date of publication, date of last revision, date of creation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 22*

It is recommended that at least the date of the last revision of a spatial data set should be reported using the _Date of last revision_ metadata sub-element.

====

=== Metadata elements for interoperability

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 13_
*Metadata required for Interoperability*

The metadata describing a spatial data set shall include the following metadata elements required for interoperability:

. Coordinate Reference System: Description of the coordinate reference system(s) used in the data set.

. Temporal Reference System: Description of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.

. Encoding: Description of the computer language construct(s) specifying the representation of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device or transmission channel.

. Topological Consistency: Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the data set as described by the scope.
+
This element is mandatory only if the data set includes types from the Generic Network Model and does not assure centreline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for the network.

. Character Encoding: The character encoding used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if an encoding is used that is not based on UTF-8.

. Spatial Representation Type: The method used to spatially represent geographic information.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to implement the required metadata elements based on ISO 19115 and ISO/TS 19139.

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with the proposed encoding.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 3*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the used ISO 19139 XML schema.

====

NOTE Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 4*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall contain the elements and meet the INSPIRE multiplicity specified in the sections below.

====

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 5*

The elements specified below shall be available in the specified ISO/TS 19139 path.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 23*

The metadata elements for interoperability should be made available together with the metadata elements defined in the Metadata Regulation through an INSPIRE discovery service.

====

NOTE While this not explicitly required by any of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, making all metadata of a data set available together and through one service simplifies implementation and usability.

==== Metadata elements for reporting data quality

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 26*

For reporting the results of the data quality evaluation, the data quality elements, sub-elements and (for quantitative evaluation) measures defined in chapter 7 should be used.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 27*

The metadata elements specified in the following sections should be used to report the results of the data quality evaluation. At least the information included in the row "Implementation instructions" should be provided.

====

The first section applies to reporting quantitative results (using the element DQ_QuantitativeResult), while the second section applies to reporting non-quantitative results (using the element DQ_DescriptiveResult).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 28*

If a dataset does not pass the tests of the Application schema conformance class (defined in Annex A), the results of each test should be reported using one of the options described in sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2.

====

NOTE 1 If using non-quantitative description, the results of several tests do not have to be reported separately, but may be combined into one descriptive statement.

NOTE 2 The sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2 may need to be updated once the XML schemas for ISO 19157 have been finalised.

The scope for reporting may be different from the scope for evaluating data quality (see section 7). If data quality is reported at the data set or spatial object type level, the results are usually derived or aggregated.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 29*

The scope element (of type DQ_Scope) of the DQ_DataQuality subtype should be used to encode the reporting scope.

Only the following values should be used for the level element of DQ_Scope: Series, Dataset, featureType.

If the level is featureType the levelDescription/MDScopeDescription/features element (of type Set< GF_FeatureType>) shall be used to list the feature type names.

====

NOTE In the level element of DQ_Scope, the value featureType is used to denote spatial object type.

== Delivery

=== Updates

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 8_
*Updates*

. Member States shall make available updates of data on a regular basis.

. All updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set, unless a different period is specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE In this data specification, no exception is specified, so all updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set.

=== Delivery medium

According to Article 11(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for INSPIRE spatial data sets and services. The relevant network service types for making spatial data available are:

* _view services_ making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;
* _download services_, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;
* _transformation services_, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability.

NOTE For the relevant requirements and recommendations for network services, see the relevant Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelinesfootnote:[The Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines on INSPIRE Network Services are available at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/5].

EXAMPLE 1 Through the Get Spatial Objects function, a download service can either download a pre-defined data set or pre-defined part of a data set (non-direct access download service), or give direct access to the spatial objects contained in the data set, and download selections of spatial objects based upon a query (direct access download service). To execute such a request, some of the following information might be required:

the list of spatial object types and/or predefined data sets that are offered by the download service (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation),

and the query capabilities section advertising the types of predicates that may be used to form a query expression (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation, where applicable),

a description of spatial object types offered by a download service instance (to be provided through the Describe Spatial Object Types operation).

EXAMPLE 2 Through the Transform function, a transformation service carries out data content transformations from native data forms to the INSPIRE-compliant form and vice versa. If this operation is directly called by an application to transform source data (e.g. obtained through a download service) that is not yet conformant with this data specification, the following parameters are required:

Input data (mandatory). The data set to be transformed.

Source model (mandatory, if cannot be determined from the input data). The model in which the input data is provided.

Target model (mandatory). The model in which the results are expected.

Model mapping (mandatory, unless a default exists). Detailed description of how the transformation is to be carried out.

=== Encodings

The IRs contain the following two requirements for the encoding to be used to make data available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 7_
*Encoding*

. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall conform to EN ISO 19118. In particular, it shall specify schema conversion rules for all spatial object types and all attributes and association roles and the output data structure used.

. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall be made available.

====

NOTE ISO 19118:2011 specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules used for interchange of geographic data within the set of International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". An encoding rule allows geographic information defined by application schemas and standardized schemas to be coded into a system-independent data structure suitable for transport and storage. The encoding rule specifies the types of data being coded and the syntax, structure and coding schemes used in the resulting data structure. Specifically, ISO 19118:2011 includes

* requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas,
* requirements for creating encoding services, and
* requirements for XML-based encoding rules for neutral interchange of data.

While the IRs do not oblige the usage of a specific encoding, these Technical Guidelines propose to make data related to the spatial data theme Geographical Names available at least in the default encoding(s) specified in section 9.3.1. In this section, a number of TG requirements are listed that need to be met in order to be conformant with the default encoding(s).

The proposed default encoding(s) meet the requirements in Article 7 of the IRs, i.e. they are conformant with ISO 19118 and (since they are included in this specification) publicly available.

==== Default Encoding(s)

===== Specific requirements for GML encoding

This data specification proposes the use of GML as the default encoding, as recommended in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of [DS-D2.7]. GML is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118, as required in Article 7(1). For details, see [ISO 19136], and in particular Annex E (UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules).

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with GML encodings.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 6*

Data instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the provided XML schema.

====

NOTE 1 Not all constraints defined in the application schemas can be mapped to XML. Therefore, the following requirement is necessary.

NOTE 2 The obligation to use only the allowed code list values specified for attributes and most of the constraints defined in the application schemas [.underline]#cannot# be mapped to the XML sch. They can therefore [.underline]#not# be enforced through schema validation. It may be possible to express some of these constraints using other schema or rule languages (e.g. Schematron), in order to enable automatic validation.

===== Default encoding(s) for application schema Addresses

*Name: Addresses GML Application Schema*
Version: version 3.0
Specification: D2.8.I.3 Data Specification on Geographical Names – Technical Guidelines
Character set: UTF-8

The xml schema document is available from _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/gn/3.0/GeographicalNames.xsd_

<<<
== Data Capture

There is no specific guidance required with respect to data capture.

<<<
== Portrayal

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for this theme. Portrayal is regulated in Article 14 of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

. For the portrayal of spatial data sets using a view network service as specified in Commission Regulation No 976/2009 (footnote:[OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9.]), the following shall be available:
[loweralpha]
.. the layers specified in Annex II for the theme or themes the data set is related to;
.. for each layer at least a default portrayal style, with as a minimum an associated title and a unique identifier.

[arabic, start=2]
. For each layer, Annex II defines the following:
[loweralpha]
.. a human readable title of the layer to be used for display in user interface;
.. the spatial object type(s), or sub-set thereof, that constitute(s) the content of the layer.

====

In section 11.1, the _types_ of layers are defined that are to be used for the portrayal of the spatial object types defined in this specification. A view service may offer several layers of the same type, one for each dataset that it offers data on a specific topic.

NOTE The layer specification in the IRs only contains the name, a human readable title and the (subset(s) of) spatial object type(s), that constitute(s) the content of the layer. In addition, these Technical Guidelines suggest keywords for describing the layer.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 30*

It is recommended to use the keywords specified in section 11.1 in the _Layers Metadata parameters_ of the INSPIRE View service (see Annex III, Part A, section 2.2.4 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009).

====

Section 11.2 specifies one style for each of these layers. It is proposed that INSPIRE view services support this style as the default style required by Article 14(1b).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 7*

For each layer specified in this section, the styles defined in section 11.2 shall be available.

====

NOTE The default style should be used for portrayal by the view network service if no user-defined style is specified in a portrayal request for a specific layer.

In section *Errore. L'origine riferimento non è stata trovata.*, further styles can be specified that represent examples of styles typically used in a thematic domain. It is recommended that also these styles should be supported by INSPIRE view services, where applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 31*

In addition, it is recommended that, where applicable, INSPIRE view services also support the styles defined in section *Errore. L'origine riferimento non è stata trovata.*.

====

Where XML fragments are used in the following sections, the following namespace prefixes apply:

* sld="http://www.opengis.net/sld" (WMS/SLD 1.1)
* se="http://www.opengis.net/se" (SE 1.1)
* ogc="http://www.opengis.net/ogc" (FE 1.1)

(...)

[arabic, start=3]
. For spatial object types whose objects can be further classified using a code list-valued attribute, several layers may be defined. Each of these layers shall include the spatial objects corresponding to one specific code list value. In the definition of such sets of layers in Annexes II-IV,
[loweralpha]
.. the placeholder <CodeListValue> shall represent the values of the relevant code list, with the first letter in upper case,
.. the placeholder <human-readable name> shall represent the human-readable name of the code list values;
.. the spatial object type shall include the relevant attribute and code list, in parentheses;

All names (i.e. all spellings of all names of the named place) are displayed in black, with font Arial 10pt, and located in order to touch the geometry of the named place, at its centre if possible.

If a named place is referred by different names or different spellings of the same name, all texts are displayed on the same line.

The order of displayed names does not indicate any preference order, as this is not possible to define precisely such an order without more information, e.g. on linguistic statuses in administrative units.

|*Symbology* |Displaying the full list of all spellings associated to the same NamedPlace seems to be an issue for the sld standard (style layer description). No sld description is thus provided.
|*Minimum & maximum scales* a|

Names should only be displayed at the viewing scale range defined by the attributes representing the least/most detailed viewing scale of the associated named place. If those attributes are not filled, then the names should be displayed at all viewing scales.


|===

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 32*

The typefaces and fonts used for the portrayal of geographical names should fully and correctly reproduce all the letters and diacritics present in the spellings of geographical names to be visualised.

[appendix]
== Abstract Test Suite - (normative)

[cols=""]
|===
a|*Disclaimer*

While this Annex refers to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services, it does not replace the legal act or any part of it.
|===

The objective of the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) included in this Annex is to help the conformance testing process. It includes a set of tests to be applied on a data set to evaluate whether it fulfils the requirements included in this data specification and the corresponding parts of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010 (implementing rule as regards interoperability of spatial datasets and services, further referred to as ISDSS Regulation). This is to help data providers in declaring the conformity of a data set to the "degree of conformity, with implementing rules adopted under Article 7(1) of Directive 2007/2/EC", which is required to be provided in the data set metadata according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2008/1205 (the Metadata Regulation).

*Part 1* of this ATS includes tests that provide *input for assessing conformity with the ISDSS regulation.* In order to make visible which requirements are addressed by a specific test, references to the corresponding articles of the legal act are given. The way how the cited requirements apply to gn specification is described under the testing method.

In addition to the requirements included in ISDSS Regulation this Technical guideline contains TG requirements too. TG requirements are technical provisions that need to be fulfilled in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement when the specific technical implementation proposed in this document is used. Such requirements relate for example to the default encoding described in section 9. *Part 2* of the ATS presents tests necessary for assessing the *conformity with TG requirements*.

NOTE Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in this ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

The *ATS is applicable to the data sets that* *have been transformed* to be made available through INSPIRE download services (i.e. the data returned as a response to the mandatory "Get Spatial Dataset" operation) rather than the original "source" data sets.

The requirements to be tested are grouped in several _conformance classes_. Each of these classes covers a specific aspect: one conformance class contains tests reflecting the requirements on the application schema, another on the reference systems, etc. *Each conformance class is identified by a URI* (uniform resource identifier) according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/gn/<conformance class identifier>

EXAMPLE 1 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ef/rs_ identifies the Reference Systems ISDSS conformance class of the Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF) data theme.

The results of the tests should be published referring to the relevant conformance class (using its URI).

When an INSPIRE data specification contains *more than one application schema,* the requirements tested in a conformance class may differ depending on the application schema used as a target for the transformation of the data set. This will always be the case for the application schema conformance class. However, also other conformance classes could have different requirements for different application schemas. In such cases, a separate conformance class is defined for each application schema, and they are distinguished by specific URIs according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/gn/<conformance class identifier>/ 
<application schema namespace prefix>

EXAMPLE 2 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/el/as/el-vec_ identifies the conformity with the application schema (_as_) conformance class for the Elevation Vector Elements (_el-vec_) application schema.

An overview of the conformance classes and the associated tests is given in the table below.

|===

In order to be conformant to a conformance class, a data set has to pass *all* tests defined for that conformance class.

In order to be conformant with the ISDSS regulation the inspected data set needs to be conformant to *all* conformance classes in Part 1. The conformance class for overall conformity with the ISDSS regulation is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/gn/._

In order to be conformant with the Technical Guidelines, the dataset under inspection needs to be conformant to all conformance classes included both in Part 1 and 2. Chapter 8 describes in detail how to publish the result of testing regarding overall conformity and conformity with the conformance classes as metadata. The conformance class for overall conformity with the Technical Guidelines is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/tg/gn/3.1._

It should be noted that data providers are not obliged to integrate / decompose the original structure of the source data sets when they deliver them for INSPIRE. It means that a conformant dataset can contain less or more spatial object / data types than specified in the ISDSS Regulation.

*A dataset that contains less spatial object and/or data types* can be regarded conformant when the corresponding types of the source datasets after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation.

A *dataset that contain more spatial object and/or data types* may be regarded as conformant when

* all the spatial object / data types that have corresponding types in the source dataset after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation and
* all additional elements of the source model (spatial object types, data types, attributes, constraints, code lists and enumerations together with their values) do not conflict with any rule defined in the interoperability target specifications defined for any theme within INSPIRE.

[.red.backround]
====
*Open issue 1:* Even though the last condition can be derived from Art. 8(4) of the Directive, the ISDSS Regulation does not contain requirements concerning the above issue. Therefore, no specific tests have been included in this abstract suite for testing conformity of extended application schemas. Annex F of the Generic Conceptual Model (D2.5) provides an example how to extend INSPIRE application schemas in a compliant way.
====

The ATS contains a detailed list of abstract tests. It should be noted that some tests in the Application schema conformance class can be automated by utilising xml *schema validation tools.* It should be noted that failing such validation test does not necessary reflect non-compliance to the application schema; it may be the results of erroneous encoding.

Each test in this suite follows the same structure:

* Requirement: citation from the legal texts (ISDSS requirements) or the Technical Guidelines (TG requirements);
* Purpose: definition of the scope of the test;
* Reference: link to any material that may be useful during the test;
* Test method: description of the testing procedure.

According to ISO 19105:2000 all tests in this ATS are basic tests. Therefore, this statement is not repeated each time.

=== Management of Danube in EuroGeoNames, illustrating the benefit of establishing cross border capabilities 

==== Description

This example describe the EuroGeoNames solution for the Danube river, crossing several countries and with several names [EGN D4.2e], through a link between "EuroGeonames Central Service" (EGN Service) and "Exonyms and other Variant Names database" (EVN-DB)

. *Typical use case in EuroGeoNames*

Typical usage of the EGN service: a German user wants to get the information about the Danube river and starts his single inquiry with "Donau". He aims at getting information (all names and the geographic extent) about the complete spatial object (which may be a combination of 9 spatial objects from 9 national data sets).

. *EGN Local Services*

Assuming that all EGN Local Services needed are running, the EGN Local Services do provide the following information:

One country/NMCA may provide more than one geographical name associated to the respective spatialObject_UID (which are unique identifiers for the respective spatial objects). The generic requirements from the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.5] apply for these identifiers.

The linkage between the "national" pieces of the whole spatial object (border-crossing spatial objects) is done within the Exonyms and other Variant Names database (EVN-DB).

The EGN Central Service does provide the respective national pieces from the EGN Local Services together with the information stored and maintained in the EVN-DB.

|===

The EVN_DB stores one set of exonyms and variant names [1..*] which will be associated to all (national) spatialObject_UIDs with cardinality [1..*].

As for the Danube river, one set of exonyms and variants are stored for 9 spatial objects – which will be linked together through the EVN-DB only.

The English exonym or variant name is always introduced if available.

Border-crossing spatial objects without associated exonyms are not linked within the EU-funded period of EuroGeoNames.

=== Vitoria-Gasteiz - multilingual name 

==== Description

"Vitoria-Gasteiz" is a multilingual official name, Vitoria is in the Spanish language and Gasteiz is in the Basque language. The placenames like this example have two geographical names in different languages and these have the same importance, they are thus used together to build the official name. These geographic names are due to by politic agreements. It can be noticed that the signs "-" and "/" do not have the same meaning in all of the placenames of Spain: when a geographical name use the sign "/" like for example in "Arrasate/Mondragón", the place has two officials names and both can be used.

== Using the datatype GeographicalName in other INSPIRE themes - (informative) 

=== Importance of names and multilingual aspects in European products

This rationale is adapted from documents of the EuroGeoNames project [EGN]

Primary access to multilingual geographic information (GI) is frequently done via an indirect form of geographical reference such as a geographical name, e.g. 'Bruxelles' or 'Brussel' or 'Brüssel' or 'Brussels', rather than through more direct referencing such as co-ordinate information e.g. latitude/longitude. The significance of the distinction between direct and indirect geographical referencing ('geo-referencing') lies in that the latter approach is more popular amongst non GI professionals but is less precise and fraught with ambiguity.

Geographical names are much more than just 'names on a map' and are not only used for the search and overview of maps but in other spatially related products as well, such as administrative reports, statistical summary tables etc. Indeed, geographical names are arguably the primary geographic referencing system used throughout Europe and thus have vast potential to inter-relate and cross-reference disparate data sources. They are therefore a critical component for the indexing, discovery and use of a broad superset of information. Their clear, unambiguous and consistent use is thus important for a wide range of administrative and decision-making tasks not only in the European Union itself, but also in the administration of all member States as well as in more specialised domain of spatially based applications.

There is no doubt, that correctly spelled multilingual geographical names are indispensable for, _inter alia_, postal services, telecommunication, health and risk management, safety and rescue services, transportation and navigation, translation services, tourism, for the purpose of popular education or for use in the mass media. Additionally, geoportals and Location Based Services (LBS) do not only need multilingual geographical names as a means for access, but also for enhancing the attractiveness of their services in general. It is also worth noting that cartographic map producers, atlas and dictionary publishers, museums, archives and libraries would also benefit from the provision of consistent and comprehensive multilingual geographical names data.

Finally, multilingual data are important to allow services based on these data to be equally accessible by all languages officially spoken in the participating European countries, including the officially recognized minority languages. In doing so, the services will help to promote cultural diversity and multilingualism in Europe and will provide a means by which users can search for geographical names spelt in their native language.

=== Modelling principles for names in INSPIRE themes 

Within the context of INSPIRE, a data model for geographical names is of course defined in this _Geogrpahical names_ specification. In addition, many other INSPIRE themes did/will define spatial objects associated with names as attributes.

In this document, it is argued that a harmonised approach for modelling attributes related to names should be followed in all the INPSIRE themes. Globally, this is important to increase the readability of INSPIRE data specifications. From the data users' point of view, this is also important to increase the ease of use of INSPIRE data sets by various applications relying on data from different themes. From the data producers' point of view, this important to minimise the efforts for transforming data from their own data model of various INSPIRE data models. The latter argument is particularly true when data providers transform one single data set into several INSPIRE data sets (e.g. a single rivers database used to populate the models specified in the _Geographical names_, _Hydrography_ and _Transport networks_ themes).

In addition, it is argued that data models defined within the context of INSPIRE should offer the possibility to provide names of related spatial objects in different languages and in different scripts, as this diversity is doubtlessly the situation in Europe.

Therefore, as this specification defines a dataType 'GeographicalName'. It is recommended to use this dataType for modelling names associated to any spatial object defined in INSPIRE and holding names, as explained below and in Figure C.1:

* the spatial object should use one attribute to model names (named for example 'name');
* this attribute should be typed by the dataType 'GeographicalName';
* this attribute should have the cardinality of [0..*] or [1..*], because of the importance of multilingual issues as explained above.

*Figure C.1 – UML class diagram: recommended use of the dataType GeographicalName in INSPIRE thematic specifications*

It should be noticed that the dataType 'GeographicalName' may look complex at first sight. However, when restricted to its non-voidable elements, this type is relatively simple in a context requiring managing names in multiple languages and in multiple scripts. More, this relative complexity is the necessary counterpart of harmonisation between all INSPIRE themes and thus should not prevent using this dataType. For the sake of simplicity, specifications of INSPIRE theme can however make some recommendations in their specification on how to fill the voidable elements of the dataType 'GeographicalName'. By this way, each specification may choose the adapted level of simplicity/richness of the model, between the ones proposed in figures C.2 and C.3.

== Mapping INSPIRE _Geographical names_ and INSPIRE Gazetteer - (informative) 

The INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model provides a schema for the INSPIRE Gazetteer shown in the following figure. This annex explains how geographical names modelled in this specification could be mapped to the main elements of the gazetteer. It does not put any requirement on geographical names, and is there for information only.

Following ISO 19112 principles, if a multi-names and multi-lingual geographical names gazetteer shall be established, then for each Spelling, a LocationInstance is built, and the Spelling.text is the geographicIdentifier.

The links between the different spellings are not lost because they are related with each other via the same abstract feature / named place. All spellings can also be cross-related with each other through alternativeGeographicIdentifier.

Different strategies can be followed, each one raising an issue:

* For each NamedPlace, one LocationInstance is built, and one among its multiple spellings is chosen as the geographicIdentifier, while the other spellings will be alternativeGeographicIdentifiers. In this case one spelling has to be chosen as a reference which may be problematic and theoretically incorrect.
* For each Spelling, a LocationInstance is built, and the Spelling.text is the geographicIdentifier. In this case, links between spellings is lost.
* For each Spelling, a LocationInstance is built, and the Spelling.text is the geographicIdentifier; while all other related spellings are its alternativeGeographicIdentifiers. In this case, the gazetteer is very redundant.

== Code for languages and transliteration schemes - (informative) 

=== Rationale behind requiring ISO 639-3 and 639-5 language codes

[.underline]#Different lists of language codes exist#

[loweralpha]
. [ISO 639-1] indicates 2 letters codes for language families/groups and for individual languages. It does not go into sufficient detail to distinguish all the individual European languages.
. [ISO 639-2] indicates 3-letters codes for language families/groups and for individual languages (number of entries: 400). It still does not go into sufficient detail to distinguish all the individual European languages (even for languages recognised as official in some administrative units of Europe).
. [ISO 639-3] is the most comprehensive list (number of entries: 7000) with the aim to cover all known natural languages. It has the disadvantage of not providing codes for language families.
. [ISO 639-5] supplements the coding of language groups and language families in [ISO 639-3]. It introduces a hierarchical relationship between languages, but does not add more detail to [ISO 639-3].

[.underline]#Discussion#

It appears that most spatial data sets in Europe use [ISO 639-2] as a reference for language of geographical names. Prominent examples are EuroGeoNames and all EuroGeographics products (EuroRegionalMap, EuroGlobalMap and EuroBoundaryMap). In addition, [ISO 639-2] is mandated in the INSPIRE Implementing Rule on metadata ([Regulation 1205/2008/EC]).

However, [ISO 639-2] does not allow for sufficient detail to distinguish all existing European languages; even some official languages in use in parts of Europe are missing. An example is on Saami languages spoken in Northern Europe: [ISO 639-2] (updated list from 2007) encodes five Saami languages separately, while the other five are grouped as 'Other Saami languages' (code 'smi').

[ISO 639-3] has the advantage of providing codes for most if not all languages used in Europe. On the Saami example, [ISO 639-3] separates all Saami languages from each other.

However, [ISO 639-3] has the disadvantage of not providing codes for language families. That may cause problems, for instance in Germany where topographic data sets refer to 'Sorbian languages' as a minority language, while [ISO 639-3] only offers codes 'Lower Sorbian' and 'Upper Sorbian'. Therefore it would not be possible to map the current German data with [ISO 639-3], while this is possible for [ISO 639-5].

[.underline]#Conclusion#

Language is a major aspect of geographical names and the choice of most appropriate codes received much attention during the preparation of this specification. The only solution enabling to code languages with sufficient details, but also enabling to code languages family as existing in some actual data sets, appeared to be a combination of the non-conflicting codes of [ISO 639-3] and [ISO 639-5].

In addition, we strongly recommend to push ISO for a useful combination of the various versions of ISO 639 language codes.

===  Rationale behind codes for transliteration schemes

[.underline]#Different code lists for transliteration schemes exist#

It appears that there now exist no sufficiently comprehensive and widely accepted unique code list of transliteration schemes maintained by some organisation like ISO or United Nations.

More, some transliteration schemes not recorded in United Nations code list are in use in Europe. In particular, the Bulgarian current official system is different from the United Nations approved one. For example, different spellings exist for 'the city of Shumen' in Bulgaria:

* "Шумен" (endonym)
** language: Bulgarian
** script: Cyrillic
** transliterationScheme: _void_
* "Šumen"
** language: Bulgarian
** script: Roman/Latin
** transliterationScheme: UN 1977
* "Shumen"
** language: Bulgarian
** script: Roman/Latin
** transliterationScheme: national 2006

[.underline]#Conclusion#

For these reasons, this specification does not recommend one unique particular code list for coding transliteration schemes.
