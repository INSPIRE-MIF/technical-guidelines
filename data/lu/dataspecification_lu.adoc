== How to read the document?

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Land Use – Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.0 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _LU_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Land Use_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Land Use_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services – General Executive Summary

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services,] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML – Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== _Land Use_ – Executive Summary

The cornerstone of the specification development was the fact that __Land Use shapes our environment in positive and negative ways. Productive land is a critical resource for food and biomass production and land use strongly influences soil erosion and soil functions such as carbon storage. Land management largely determines the beauty of Europe's landscapes. It is important therefore to monitor land cover and land-use change__footnote:[SOER Synthesis, 2010. The European environment — state and outlook 2010: synthesis. European Environment Agency, Copenhagen.].

In the INSPIRE directive, _Land Use_ is defined as Territory characterised according to its current and future planned functional dimension or socio-economic purpose (e.g. residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural, forestry, recreational). [Directive 2007/2/EC] It is the description of land in terms or its socio-economic and ecological purpose. The inland water bodies as well as coastal waters are considered within the connected piece of land and planning of the use of sea and the use of seabed has been taken into consideration.

_Land Use_ is itself split up into two different types:

[arabic, start=1]
. The Existing _Land Use_ (current land use in the above definition), which objectively depicts the use and functions of a territory as it has been and effectively still is in real life. Geographical data-sets that provide _Land Use_ information, at the time of observation, are modeled according to three application schemas:
[loweralpha]
.. organized as a partition (in the mathematical sense) of a given area. Each element of the partition is homogeneous regarding the functional use of land. (ExistingLandUse application schema),

.. organized as a set of discrete observation points informing on the functional use at the exact location and/or at its surrounding at the time of observation, (SampledExistingLandUse application schema),

.. organized as a set of pixels informing on the functional use (GriddedExistingLandUse application schema)

[arabic, start=2]
. The Planned _Land Use_ or PLU (future planned land use in the above definition), which corresponds to spatial plans, defined by spatial planning authorities, depicting the possible utilization of the land in the future. Planned land use is regulated by spatial planning documents elaborated at various levels of administration. _Land Use_ regulation over a geographical area is in general composed of an overall strategic orientation, a textual regulation and a cartographic representation. Spatial planning documents result from the spatial planning process, once adopted and therefore which third parties must conform with. The scope of the INSPIRE _Land Use_ Data Specification is giving the exact spatial dimension of all the elements a spatial plan is composed of. Planned _Land Use_ application schema is mainly based on ZoningElement that depicts the zoning defined by spatial planners and SupplementaryRegulation that enables to inform on regulations that superimpose on the zoning.

The _Land Use_ data specification supports two systems of classification:

* the (obligatory) Hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ Classification System (HILUCS) which is a multi-level, classification system that will apply to both the existing and planned land use
* the (optional) specific classification system in use in a member state.

_Land Use_ has connexion with several other INSPIRE themes but it has been preferred not to include relationships with these themes in the model assuming that geometric functions of user information systems will enable to compute the spatial relationships. For example the inclusion of a feature from another theme in a _Land Use_ feature or the overlap between them can be recomputed with spatial analysis tools.

In the _Land Use_ data specification the description of the use of land will not provide the description of the geographical objects as done in the other theme. For example, an area in which energy is produced will be seen as a unique object in a _Land Use_ datasets where in the Energy resource theme more detailed description of the plant may be provided including differentiation of its parts.

As stated by the INSPIRE directive, _Land Use_ is different from Land Cover (LC, Annex II, theme number 2). The choice has been made to consider those two themes with different geometries.

Planned _Land Use_ information is often overlaid on cadastral maps or other background mapping such as orthoimagery. The choice has been made to allow the data provider to inform on the version of the background map which the spatial plan has been drawn over without implementing direct relationships with the corresponding theme as described in the INSPIRE Data Specification .

Planned land use incorporate elements that in the real world can be related to other INSPIRE spatial data themes (see Figure 1) such as Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units (AM, Annex III theme 11) or Natural Risk Zones (NZ, annex III theme 12). These will be seen as supplementary regulation in the _Land Use_ data model (planned land Use) as soon as this information is incorporated in the legal spatial plan, i.e. only information that is geographical and legally binding in the spatial plan will be considered as a supplementary regulation although it may belong to another theme.

*Figure 1: Relation of the land use theme with the area management and natural risk zone theme.*

Comparable data on top of harmonised specification elements create additional value for achieving interoperability in INSPIRE. For this finality the data specification on _Land Use_ includes recommendations on reporting data quality parameters.

Regardless whether these recommendations on data quality are met, the actual values of data quality elements should be published as metadata. These elements usually have to be published at the dataset level.

For visualisation purposes, simple rules for default portrayal are given by specifying the colour attached to classes of the Hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ Classification System.

The main value of the INSPIRE _Land Use_ model is its simplicity, a yet flexible structure that allows data providers to publish their existing data in the most convenient way. It is expected that the effective use of the model will help explaining how to implement this data specification including how to use it for structure plans and construction plans.

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Land Use_ as defined in Annex III of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme _Land Use_.

=== Informal description

*Definition:*

Territory characterised according to its current and future planned functional dimension or socio–economic purpose (e.g. residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural, forestry, recreational). [Directive 2007/2/EC]

*Description:*

The definition of the INSPIRE spatial data theme '_Land Use_' stresses two important parts of this theme:

First of all _Land Use_ is defined as the *use* and *functions* of a territory. It is the description of land in terms of its socio-economic and ecological purpose. _Land Use_ is different from Land Cover (Annex III, theme number 3), dedicated to the description of the surface of the earth by its (bio-)physical characteristics. Land Cover and _Land Use_ are, however, related and often combined in practical applications. Data sets combining _Land Use_ and Land Cover often emphasize land use aspects in intensively used areas and land cover aspects in extensively used areas. An example of the difference in description of the same piece of land would be an agricultural area with grass. In Land Cover it would be described as a pasture (the cover of the land is grass), while in _Land Use_ it would be classified as agriculture (its use would be for grazing cattle).

Secondly _Land Use_ is itself split up into two different types (see Table 1):

* The existing land use (current land use in the above definition), which objectively depicts the use and functions of a territory as it has been and effectively still is in real life. Existing land use will be modeled according to three application schemas:
** The Existing _Land Use_ or ELU composed of polygons,
** The Sampled _Land Use_ or SLU which corresponds to the use and functions as observed around a set of locations sampled over a given area,
** The Gridded _Land Use_ or GLU which correspond to a georeferenced gridded version of an existing land use dataset.
* The Planned _Land Use_ or PLU (future planned land use in the above definition), which is composed of spatial plans, defined by spatial planning authorities, depicting the possible utilization of the land in the future. The corresponding application schema contains either a vector data or a raster data.

*Table 1– different types of land use datasets and the corresponding application schemas*

To accommodate the wide variety of spatial information that is already available on _Land Use_, the application schemas described in chapter 5 are as open ended as possible. They are based on a common aspect which can be applied for ELU, SLU, GLU and PLU, and supports two different systems of classification. First of all there is the **H**ierarchical **I**NSPIRE *_Land Use_* **C**lassification System (HILUCS). This is a new, multi-level, classification system. It will be general enough for the member states to map their specific classification system to the appropriate level of HILUCS. This classification system will allow comparing the different data sets from different member states. It has been necessary to define HILUCS as no existing classification system was fulfilling the requirements for consistently describing existing and planned land use in Europe. The second possibility is to add the local classification system of the member state, or in the case of PLU, the authority issuing the plan. This local system should however be well documented, allowing users to use the data and compare it with datasets from other sources.

The scope of the theme _Land Use_ does not only include the actual earth's surface (the use at ground level), but can also indicate which uses are directly below or above ground level, restricted to their physical impact at ground level. A mine for instance can be completely below the surface but still be the land use. Another example is a high rise set of buildings which includes shops on the ground floor and residences on the other floors.

In most cases human activities occur on areas that include the "infrastructures" necessary for the activity to take place (e.g. an industrial area includes the car-parks necessary for the staff and clients, gardens necessary for the "well fare", warehouses for the stocks, front office – back office). The inland water bodies as well as coastal waters are considered within the connected piece of land as soon as they participate to the use or function of that connected piece of land, e.g. a harbour includes the water that is inside the harbour. More generally their use may be documented according to HILUCS.

Planning of the use of sea and the use of seabed has been taken into consideration. HILUCS is applicable although some further work is needed to construct the correspondence between HILUCS and the terminology used in this area of spatial planning.

==== Existing land use 

Geographical data-sets that provide _Land Use_ information, at the time of observation, are often organised as a partition (in the mathematical sense) of a given area (see Figure 2). They are called Existing _Land Use_ (ELU). Each element of the partition (polygon) is homogeneous regarding the functional use of land. The fact that one land use is defined does not mean only one land use exists, the model will enable the possibility to also provide the other kinds of land use in the same area. The polygons do not overlap each other (i.e. "polygons" are mutually exclusive). The area covered by a _Land Use_ data set may differ from the area managed by an authority. For example a local government may be responsible for the data set but the area covered by the data set may be smaller than the administrative boundaries of the local government or may have holes. That may be due to multiple reason including the data capture method (e.g. from imagery) or the legal context.

Geographical data-sets that provide _Land Use_ information, at the time of observation, may also be organised as discrete set of points each of them being observed and associated with attributes describing the land use. It will be called Sampled _Land Use_ (SLU) (see Figure 3)

Gridded _Land Use_ (GLU) is a way of presenting existing land use in a raster form. (see Figure 4)

A nomenclature provides the functional uses that are taken into consideration; many nomenclatures exist in the world today, from those applicable at continental level, to those defined locally. For the INSPIRE _Land Use_ theme the new HILUCS classification system will be used (e.g. area used for primary production such as agriculture or forestry, for secondary production such as industrial areas, for transport networks, logistics or other basic infrastructure, for residential etc.).

Each separate dataset of Existing _Land Use_ will be a snapshot of a certain moment in time, the added value of these separate datasets with different timestamps is the fact that _Land Use_ changes over time can be monitored if they are put together.

Associated with the nomenclature, the minimum unit of interest (also called minimum mapping unit or observation unit) defines the level of detail within the dataset, i.e. the minimum size of the polygons or the minimum distance between observation points that are in the dataset. This information is provided within the metadata associated with the dataset.

==== Planned land use

In the context of INSPIRE, sharing land use information supports the requirements common in spatial planning. The spatial plans established at the various levels of administration need to be supported by other spatial plans made by public authorities at different levels or even with spatial plans across the border of a nation. Different zoning elements across borders can have a great influence on each other.

Planned land use is regulated by spatial planning documents elaborated at various levels of administration.

_Land Use_ regulation over a geographical area (spatial planning documents resulting from the spatial planning process, once adopted and therefore which third parties must conform with) is often composed of three parts:

* the overall strategic orientation that describes the development will of the competent administrative authority which is a textual document,
* the textual regulation that affects each zone and orientates the planned land use. It is composed of articles and dictates what is possible and impossible with regard to the use of land,
* the cartographic representation composed of elements that are binding (affecting the actual rights and constraints of cadastral parcels) or not binding (e.g. for illustration only).

Although the original planned _Land Use_ documents are legally binding the derived INSPIRE dataset is not.

The scope of the INSPIRE _Land Use_ Data Specification is giving the exact spatial dimension of all the elements a spatial plan is composed of. These elements can be based on other INSPIRE spatial data themes, like Cadastral Parcels, Area Management Zones or Natural Risk Zones. The main spatial objects of a spatial plan will be the zoning elements and the supplementary regulations that add regulations to the zoning elements. Additional information like the exact textual regulation will be linked to these objects.

Until now, there is no agreed nomenclature at the international level regarding planned land use. Like for the Existing _Land Use_ the new HILUCS nomenclature will be mandatory to be used at the most appropriate level. But besides this mandatory classification system, any other system like the local system which is supposed to be well documented can also be added.

Spatial planning is performed at several governmental levels and the cartographic expression of the regulation differs in its graphical expression as well as the concepts that are represented. It is worth mentioning that due to the terms of the directive itself, the local governments being at the lower level of administration in any member state will have to make available their spatial plan only if a law imposes the responsibility on them to produce such spatial plans.

Below the illustrative description of structure plans – zoning plans – and constructions plans is an example reflecting the different levels of detail in which planned land use can be spatially represented. Other plan types may exist in the EU.

Plans on different administrative levels have different uses and therefore different values, but one is not better than the other. Structure plans give a different type of information as opposed to construction plans, more detail does not necessarily mean more value, especially when viewed on an European level. It is therefore important that plans on all levels can be exchanged using INSPIRE.

The area covered by a Planned _Land Use_ data set may differ from the area managed by the local government responsible for. The area covered by the data set may be smaller than the administrative boundaries of the local government or may have holes. That may be due to multiple reason including the legal context.

*Structure plans.* At a level of a wide area (several thousands of km², i.e. a country, a state, or a region), spatial planning documents outline the spatial structures and development in pursuance of spatial planning goals (see Figure 5). All public bodies and planning authorities must ensure that planning and measures affecting spatial structures are strictly compliant with the spatial planning goals. In the INSPIRE context, they are seen as geographic information. The concepts cartographically represented include "areas loosing attractiveness", "areas that require controlled development", "economic area of metropolitan importance", "green heart", "green belt around cities", "peri-urban area with rural predominance", "ecological corridors", "liaison between ecological corridors" "limits and intensity of potential areas of urban expansion", "reinforcement project of public transportation networks". The cartographic expressions are not always binding when they are given for illustration only, although the textual parts are legally binding. In the INSPIRE context, these cartographic representation may be viewed as simple drawings, being either raster or vector. In case of legally binding georeferenced Structure Plans, it could be also implemented as any other spatial plan with its Zoning Elements, Supplementary Regulations and Official Documentation. Some suggestions on how structure plans can be modelled is given in Annex I of this document (based on testing reports).

*Zoning Plans.* At a level of a municipality or group of municipalities (i.e. several hundred of km²), the concepts cartographically represented includes the zoning and supplementary regulations (such as easements) (see Figure 6). Zoning refers to a partition where the planned land use is depicted. To each polygon are attached articles of the regulation that explicit the rights and prohibitions regarding new constructions or modification to existing constructions. Supplementary regulations overlap the zoning where it exists and provide additional information and/or limitations to the development of the area. The supplementary regulations can be for spatial planning reasons, or due to the need to formalise external regulations. They affect the constructability of cadastral parcels and therefore have "well-defined" boundaries. In the INSPIRE context, they are seen as geographic information.

*Figure 6 –examples of cartographic representation of zoning and supplementary regulations. Left: Green lines represent the zoning overlaid on cadastre. Right: Supplementary regulations overlaid on cadastre and zoning*

*Construction Plans*. At a development area level (i.e. few km²) the concept cartographically represented are the actual geographical objects that will be created such as building, parking lots, gardens (see Figure 7). This detailed level is not really necessary to be exchanged on a European level, but may be exchanged between public authorities at a local level, perhaps even across borders of member states. In the INSPIRE context, they may be seen as geographic information or as simple drawings.

==== Interrelationships with INSPIRE spatial data themes

===== Similarities between _Land Use_ and other INSPIRE Themes

There is a similarity between the scope of _Land Use_ (LU) and the following themes:


* Annex I: Protected Sites (PS) and Annex III: Area Management, Restriction and Regulation Zones (AM) and Natural Risk Zones (NZ)

* Annex III: Land Cover (LC)

* Annex III: Agricultural and Aquacultural Facilities (AF), Production and Industrial Facilities (PF) and Utility and Governmental Services(US)

* Annex III: Building (BU)


*Similarity between LU and PS, AM and NZ*

The key difference between LU and the three themes is that PS, AM and NZ are established to manage, regulate and restrict any activities in a given area where LU (planned land use) only considers these area as supplementary regulations only if they are bundled into the spatial plan as a whole. Thus when a zone has been established to regulate planned land use and defined within a legally binding spatial plan it falls within the scope of the _Land Use_ theme and as such be encoded as a SupplementaryRegulation.

*Similarity between LU and LC*

The key difference between LU and LC is that LC describes the surface of the earth by its (bio‑)physical characteristics where LU defines the *use* and *functions* of a territory in terms of its socio-economic and ecological purpose

*Similarity between LU and AF, PF and US*

The key difference between LU and the three themes is that AF, PF and US describe in details the objects relevant to their theme such as a farm, a plant of a governmental office, where LU defines the piece of land which use corresponds to a primary, secondary or tertiary economic sector as defined by the HILUCS code attach to the piece of land.

*Similarity between LU and BU*

The key difference between LU and BU is that BU does not take account of the surroundings of any building where LU incorporates inside a piece of land all the objects that contributes to the same socio-economic and ecological purpose.

===== Interrelationships between _Land Use_ and other INSPIRE Themes

Because of the wide heterogeneity of activities covered by HILUCS, several interrelationships with other INSPIRE spatial data themes exist.

*Associations or relationships between spatial objects*

No associations have been defined between spatial object types of other themes to represent explicit relationships. It has been considered to expensive for producers to compute them and it has been preferred to let the users recompute them using the feature geometry.

*_Land Use_ shares the same geometry as another INSPIRE spatial object*

_Land Use_ features are often defined based on the extent of another related spatial object such as cadastral parcels (planned land use) or land cover polygons (existing land use). These shared geometry has not been considered in the data model. Regarding cadastral parcels, the share of geometry is not stable with time as a spatial plan often refers to a cadastral map as it existed when the plan was adopted.

*Definition:*

Territory characterised according to its current and future planned functional dimension or socio–economic purpose (e.g. residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural, forestry, recreational).

*Description*

_Land Use_ theme is defined as the use and functions of a territory and it is description of land in terms of its socio-economic and ecological purpose. _Land use_ theme is itself split in two different types:

- The Existing Land Use which objectively depicts the use and functions of a territory as it has been and effectively still is in real life

- The Planned Land Use which corresponds to spatial plans, defined by spatial planning authorities, depicting the possible utilization of the land in the future.

Two types of classification systems are supported by _Land Use_ theme, the (obligatory) Hierarchical INSPIRE Land Use Classification System which is a multi-level, classification system that will apply to the existing and planned land use; the (optional) specific classification system in use in a member state.

An objective depiction of the use and functions of a territory as it has been and effectively still is in real life.

[arabic, start=4]
. *Gridded _Land Use_* 
+
An objective depiction as a regular orthorectified grid (image) of the use and functions of a territory as it has been and effectively still is in real life.

[arabic, start=5]
. *Hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ Classification System (HILUCS)*
+
A multi-level classification system for _Land Use_ whose use is mandatory at the most appropriate level.

=== XML Extensible Markup Language How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 8 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

*Figure 8 - Relationship between INSPIRE Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines*

==== Requirements

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Land Use_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme _Land Use_ in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).
====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X*
This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.
====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X*
Recommendations are shown using this style.
====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

<<<
== Specification scopes

This data specification does not distinguish different specification scopes, but just considers one general scope.

NOTE For more information on specification scopes, see [ISO 19131:2007], clause 8 and Annex D.

<<<
== Identification information

These Technical Guidelines are identified by the following URI:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/tg/lu/3.0

NOTE ISO 19131 suggests further identification information to be included in this section, e.g. the title, abstract or spatial representation type. The proposed items are already described in the document metadata, executive summary, overview description (section 2) and descriptions of the application schemas (section 5). In order to avoid redundancy, they are not repeated here.

== Data content and structure

=== Application schemas – Overview 

==== Application schemas included in the IRs

Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Implementing Rules lay down the requirements for the content and structure of the data sets related to the INSPIRE Annex themes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 4
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

1. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

2. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

3. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme _Land Use_ are defined in the following application schemas (see following sections):

* _Land Use_ Nomenclature application schema
* Existing _Land Use_ application schema
* Gridded _Land Use_ application schema
* Sampled _Land Use_ application schema
* Planned _Land Use_ application schema

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

NOTE The application schemas presented in this section contain some additional information that is not included in the Implementing Rules, in particular multiplicities of attributes and association roles.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 1*
Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the multiplicities defined for the attributes and association roles in this section.

====

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema – across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 5
*Types*

(...)

2. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.

3. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 2 below.

*Table 2 – Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The «voidable» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided – either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 1*
The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The «voidable» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the «voidable» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the «voidable» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=5]
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

1) Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:

a) code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;

b) code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;

c) code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;

d) code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 2*
Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.

. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 3*
Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows.


INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>/<value>.


* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined.


Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists.

The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:


* The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.

* The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".

* In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.

* The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones.



Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.


[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 4*
The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<UpperCamelCaseName>_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "\{complete,disjoint}".

*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

1. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.

2. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier which is published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. [DS-D2.5]

NOTE 2 Article 9(1) is implemented in each application schema by including the attribute _inspireId_ of type Identifier.

NOTE 3 Article 9(2) is ensured if the _namespace_ and _localId_ attributes of the Identifier remains the same for different versions of a spatial object; the _version_ attribute can of course change.

(ed.), OpenGIS® Implementation Standard for Geographic information – Simple feature access – Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

==== Coverages

Coverage functions are used to describe characteristics of real-world phenomena that vary over space and/or time. Typical examples are temperature, elevation, precipitation, imagery. A coverage contains a set of such values, each associated with one of the elements in a spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal domain. Typical spatial domains are point sets (e.g. sensor locations), curve sets (e.g. isolines), grids (e.g. orthoimages, elevation models), etc.

In INSPIRE application schemas, coverage functions are defined as properties of spatial object types where the type of the property value is a realisation of one of the types specified in ISO 19123.

To improve alignment with coverage standards on the implementation level (e.g. ISO 19136 and the OGC Web Coverage Service) and to improve the cross-theme harmonisation on the use of coverages in INSPIRE, an application schema for coverage types is included in the Generic Conceptual Model in 9.9.4. This application schema contains the following coverage types:

* _RectifiedGridCoverage_: coverage whose domain consists of a rectified grid – a grid for which there is an affine transformation between the grid coordinates and the coordinates of a coordinate reference system (see Figure 9, left).
* _ReferenceableGridCoverage_: coverage whose domain consists of a referenceable grid – a grid associated with a transformation that can be used to convert grid coordinate values to values of coordinates referenced to a coordinate reference system (see Figure 9, right).

In addition, some themes make reference to the types TimeValuePair and Timeseries defined in Taylor, Peter (ed.), _OGC^®^ WaterML 2.0: Part 1 – Timeseries, v2.0.0,_ Open Geospatial Consortium, 2012. These provide a representation of the time instant/value pairs, i.e. time series (see Figure 10).

Where possible, only these coverage types (or a subtype thereof) are used in INSPIRE application schemas.

*Figure 10 – Example of a time series*

Conceptually the _Land Use_ theme has a coverage component expressing the partition of a given area but technology is not yet fully operational and user communities not yet prepared to use coverages. Therefore it is recommended when the coverage technology will be widely implemented in operational tools to provide _Land Use_ data according to coverages. In the meanwhile it is recommended to use a set of polygons with the constraint that these polygons do not overlap.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 6*
The use of coverage for _Land Use_ dataset will be recommended once the technology is effectively implemented in operational tools.

=== Application schema _Land Use_

==== Description

===== Narrative description and UML Overview

There is a multitude of different ways to describe land use. This is partly due to the wide range of aspects of the functional use of land embraced by land use, partly due to the versatility of the land use data, and partly due to the confusion between land use and land cover in existing datasets. There is only one "real world" but many different descriptions of this world circulate (depending on the aims, methodology and terminology of the observer). A common application schema cannot support all uses across all computer environments.

Therefore many, sometimes incompatible, ways of describing land use will continue to exist. _Land Use_ classification starts from a universe of discourse – "the real world". This universe is analyzed according to a set of rules regarding the functional dimension of the land and water in terms of the economic activities in order to establish a classification system. A selected list of classes, also named LUTypes (possibly parameterized) from the classification system, generates a nomenclature (analogous to a Feature catalogue) as part of any particular Application schema.

Different classification systems can be matched and compared when they are well documented.

The solution used in this INSPIRE data specification is therefore to create an application schema (named _Land Use_) that defines feature types but is as open ended as possible with respect to particular classification systems. This approach assures that a wide range of data based on different land use classification systems can co-exist in INSPIRE, as long as these systems are sufficiently well documented. The application schema provides mechanisms to document several classification systems. In order to allow progress in the area of semantic interoperability, i.e. the capacity to compare datasets natively connected to various classification systems, the application schema proposes a hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ classification system (HILUCS), general enough to allow any _Land Use_ feature to be linked to a _Land Use_ type from the classification system. This applies to all land use datasets. This HILUCS is hierarchical in order to allow semantic generalisation and flexibility.

The _Land Use_ theme is itself split up into four application schemas according to their temporal reference and definition (see Table 3):

* The existing land use (current land use in the INSPIRE definition), which objectively depicts the use and functions of a territory as it has been and effectively still is in real life. Existing land use will be modelled according to three forms:
** The Existing _Land Use_ or ELU composed of polygons which objectively depicts the use and functions of a territory as it has been and effectively still is in real life.
** The Sampled _Land Use_ or SLU which corresponds to the use and functions as observed around a set of locations sampled over a given area.
** The Gridded _Land Use_ or GLU which correspond to a geo-referenced gridded version of an existing land use dataset.
* The Planned _Land Use_ or PLU (Future Planned _Land Use_ in the INSPIRE definition), which is composed of spatial plans, defined by spatial planning authorities, depicting the possible utilization of the land in the future. This information could be modelled either as polygons,lines and points or as raster data.

image::./media/image68.png[image,width=390,height=280, align=center]

*Table 3 – Classification of the _Land Use_ application schemas according to their temporal reference and geometry definition*

For building the _Land Use_ application schemas, common aspects are first defined for _Land Use_, it includes the HILUCS principles (see section 5.3.1.1.1). These common aspects are then applied for the description of the existing land use application schema (present or past) (see section 5.3.1.1.2), the sampled land use application schema (see section 5.3.1.1.3), the gridded land use application schema (see section 5.3.1.1.4) and the planned land use application schema (see section 5.3.1.1.5).

====== Common aspects

The common aspects for _Land Use_ corresponds to a _Land Use_ dataset that covers an area and provides a partition of that area with polygons that are mutually exclusive or with pixels (see Figure 11). The area covered by a _Land Use_ data set may differ from the area managed by an authority due to multiple reasons including the data capture method (e.g. from imagery) or the legal context. The common aspects are also valid for a _Land Use_ dataset that provide _Land Use_ information attached to a discrete set of location (samples) as shown in Figure 11. These polygons and locations are described by a land use category.

The covered area can be irregularly shaped and multipart. The covered area of a dataset, also called extent, is defined depending on the dataset type and form. It is defined as the boundary of the geometrical union of all the land use objects present in the dataset.

image::./media/image21.png[image,width=390,height=280, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 11 – showing three types of datasets containing _Land Use_ information: Top left polygons overlaid on an orthophotography, Top right pixels overlaid on administrative boundaries and water bodies, Down left set of discrete location, Down right classification system shown as a legend*

The common aspects enable the assignment of a land use category to each polygon, pixel or location from the hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ classification system (HILUCS) through HILUCS values and presences (see Figure 12).

image::./media/image22.png[image,width=605,height=430, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 12 – UML Overview the common aspects and the _Land Use_ classification systems*

HILUCS will gradually evolve in a consistent way. The responsible body guiding this evolution is yet to be defined. The objective is to move towards a stable classification system at the European level. In order to ensure a minimum level of interoperability, it is mandatory to use the appropriate level of HILUCS that best fits the local nomenclatures.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV Section 4.8_
*Theme specific requirements*

Any _Land Use_ data sets shall assign to each polygon, pixel or location a land use type from the Hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ Classification System (HILUCS) at the most appropriate and detailed level of the hierarchy.
====

The mandatory HILUCS code will allow to consistently visualise datasets from diverse sources with the same legend.

HILUCSValue has a «codeList» data type in order to connect to a register managed within INSPIRE.

The common aspects also enable the assignment of a land use category from at least one classification system that is stable and well-defined either at an international (such as SEEA from the UN, LUCAS from Eurostat), national or infra-national level, through specific values or presences. Mapping such a specific land use classification system with HILUCS will improve interoperability. Examples of such mapping is provided in annex D.

Any well-defined and stable classification system defined at a national or infra-national level shall be stored in a register managed by the member states. These code lists do not need to be translated in English but only the correspondence between the national codes and the HILUCS code shall be documented.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 7*
If specific land use is provided, the authority managing any well-defined and stable Classification system should document a mapping with the Hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ Classification System (HILUCS).

====

In order to allow progress in the area of semantic interoperability, i.e. the capacity to compare datasets connected to various (national) classification systems, the proposed hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ classification system (HILUCS) is general enough to allow any _Land Use_ features to be linked to a _Land Use_ type from the classification system. This applies to any land use data sets. HILUCS is hierarchical in order to allow semantic generalisation and flexibility.

For the definition of HILUCS the following principles have been applied:

* Completeness: the classification enables to cover the entire land area for all types of land use including land without specific use.
* Absence of overlap: the classification enables to assign for each piece of land a land use descriptor that describes the land use.
* Dominance: this is to account for multi-purpose nature of land-use. The use corresponds to the use of a piece of land as a whole. The use is not always easy to define and is most of the time based on pragmatic rules or on political will in the case of planned land use.
* Independency of scale and data collection tools: the classification, mainly due to its hierarchical nature, enables the accommodation of data obtained from different sources and at any scale.
* Strict logic: the classification has a sound foundation that is further explained in this section.
* Time independency: as the _Land Use_ Theme addresses both the existing and the planned land use, the classification enables the definition of both the land use at the time of observation and the land use that is planned by spatial planning authorities.

The HILUCS has tried to be as pragmatic and easy to understand as possible in order to promote a consistent terminology. Rules for describing and naming headings for classes have reused widely recognized rationale and definitions such as NACE, LUCAS, SEEA. As this is a first attempt in the INSPIRE context, there should be a mechanism to manage the evolution of HILUCS. The next step of HILUCS will add characteristics representing the socio-economic aspects of the use of land necessary for environmental impact assessment.

The hierarchical nature of HILUCS has been devised based on two dimensions: the land and water perspective, and the economic perspective (see Figure 13). The objective is to provide a list of generic classes that every country could implement in their _Land Use_ datasets at costs as marginal as possible enabling a basic level of semantic interoperability between datasets from all countries.

Planning of the use of sea and the use of seabed has been taken into consideration. HILUCS is applicable although some further work is needed to construct the correspondence between HILUCS and the terminology used in this area of spatial planning.

It must be noted that the models are not meant to provide information on the use of the underground of land unless they indicate which uses are directly below or above ground level, restricted to their physical impact at ground level.

From the land perspective (and how territories function) three aspects have been taken into consideration:

* Nature: it is the piece of land or water where most biodiversity (animal and vegetation) exists and develops. Obviously the agricultural land as well as forests and water bodies fall within nature as from a biodiversity point of view, animals use these areas for feeding or moving [Oxford dictionary says: Nature is the phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth].
* Networking: it is the piece of land enabling people to get connected to each other. Thus it includes roads, railways, canals and by extension electricity, gas and telecommunication networks.
* Built up: these are the places where most of human activities take place when they are not in the natural environment or while travelling. Thus it includes residential areas as well as manufactures and mining & quarrying but also stadiums and sports area.

From an economical perspective, modern economy distinguishes at a basic level three activity categories:

* The primary sector of the economy involves the extraction and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron.
* The secondary sector of the economy involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods. This sector is often divided into light industry and heavy industry. Many of these industries consume large quantities of energy and require factories and machinery to convert the raw materials into goods and products. They also produce waste materials and waste heat that may pose environmental problems or cause pollution.
* The tertiary sector of the economy involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses, activities where people offer their knowledge, skills and time to improve productivity, performance, potential, and sustainability. The basic characteristic of this sector is the production of services instead of end products. Services (also known as "intangible goods") include attention, advice, experience, and discussion. It includes a way to describe a knowledge-based part of the economy which typically includes services such as information generation and sharing, information technology, consultation, education, research and development, financial planning, and other knowledge-based services as well as government.

From an INSPIRE point of view most of the 34 themes actually directly or indirectly refer to geographical objects of the real world. These objects may be connected to land use. The list below is an indication of the INSPIRE themes connected to _Land Use_. HILUCS is not meant to describe the uses in the same detail as the other themes do.

* annex I theme 7 and 8 is dealing with transport and hydrographical networks,
* annex II theme 4 geology may be dealing with surface bed rocks,
* annex III theme 2 building may enable to derive _Land Use_ class from the information of activities occurring in buildings within a specific area
* annex III theme 5 may include hospitals and clinics,
* annex III theme 6 is dealing with Utility and government services,
* annex III themes 8 and 9 with production, industrial, agricultural and aquaculture facilities,
* annex III theme 18 with habitats and biotopes, and
* annex III theme 20 and 21 with energy resources and mineral resources.

Combining the 3 categories of the Land perspective and the 3 categories of the economic perspective one can relate the different characteristics of _Land Use_ that are relevant to each combination.

[.text-center]
*Figure 13 – Land perspective and economic perspective in HILUCS*

The use of HILUCS (necessarily multi-language) is a first attempt. It will require revisiting within three years and it is recommended to place the maintenance under the auspices of CEMAT with potentially EEA as the actual secretariat and EIONET as the technical body to involve member states. An alternative would be to use EUROSTAT or DG Regio and ESPON to instrument the maintenance of HILUCS.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 8*

It is recommended that a working party within INSPIRE shall be entrusted to propose an authority, a process and a mechanism for managing the evolution of HILUCS.

====

====== Existing land use

The Existing _Land Use_ application schema (see Figure 14) corresponds to a dataset that depicts the reality of the land use at a certain time.

Usage of dataset depicting existing land use may require providing information on the same piece of land at different time. The application schema does not implement this requirement. It means that the existing land use on the same area at two different times will be provided as two different datasets.

The «featureType» ExistingLandUseDataset contains the ExistingLandUseObject that correspond to an area having a unique defined land use.

An ExistingLandUseDataset may be created from several sources. Thus each ExistingLandUseObject may be associated with the time the documented land use corresponds to (attribute observationDate of «featureType» ExistingLandUseObject in Figure 14).

image::./media/image24.png[image,width=604,height=241, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 14 – UML Overview of the Existing _Land Use_ application schema*

The Existing _Land Use_ application schema enables the provision of information on land uses inside one land use object. The ExistingLandUseObject may be associated with

* 1 to many hilucsLandUse that represents the _Land Use_ for the polygon from the economical point of view. It makes possible the assignment of more than one hilucsLandUse existence when they cannot be managed by hilucsPresences.
* 0 to many «dataType» hilucsPresence and specificPresence to collect more than one hilucsLandUse existence perfectly identifiable by importance order or percentages.
* 1 to many specificLandUse from other well-defined and stable classification system (national or local).
* 0 to many «dataType» specificPresence, to collect more than one specificLandUse existence perfectly identifiable by importance order or percentages.

According to these possibilities, four situations are identified (see Table 4):

* the land use object is associated with just one land use, its dominant land use: hilucsLandUse will have only one value (cardinality of 1) (see Figure 15 )


image::./media/image25.jpeg[type1-exampleA,width=557,height=406]

[.text-center]
*Figure 15 – _Land Use_ object with only one hilucsLandUse value*

* the land use object is associated with several land uses with no knowledge of relative importance: hilucsLandUse will have several values (cardinality greater than 1). This fact happens in different circumstances, when mapping between national classes and HILUCS is not complete for few detail in national classes (example A); or when information is supplied at different vertical levels (example B) or at different times (example C) (see Figure 16):

image::./media/image26.jpeg[type2-exampleA,width=470,height=302]


image::./media/image27.jpeg[type2-exampleB,width=604,height=257]


image::./media/image28.jpeg[type2-exampleC,width=372,height=331]

[.text-center]
*Figure 16 – _Land Use_ object with several hilucsLandUse value with no knowledge of relative importance*

* the land use object is associated with several land uses with the knowledge of relative importance but no knowledge of the proportion: HilucsLandUse will have one value (cardinality of 1) being the dominant land use and hilucsPresence will provide the ordered list of land use but without informing on percentages (see Figure 17),


image::./media/image29.jpeg[type3-exampleA,width=504,height=357]

[.text-center]
*Figure 17 – _Land Use_ object with several hilucsLandUse value with knowledge of relative importance*

* the land use object is associated with several land uses with the knowledge of relative importance and proportion: HilucsLandUse will have one value (cardinality of 1) being the dominant land use, and hilucsPresence will provide the ordered list of land use together with percentages (see Figure 18),


image::./media/image30.jpeg[type3-exampleB,width=543,height=301]

[.text-center]
*Figure 18 – _Land Use_ object with several hilucsLandUse value with knowledge of relative importance and propotion*

image::./media/image69.png[image, align="center"]

*Table 4 – Options for representing land uses*

The opportunity of providing several land uses will not indicate the location of each land uses but it will enable the provision of their relative importance, and the opportunity of providing their respective percentages gives the possibility to enable calculations of the surface of each land use inside one area. But only one type of presence (importance orders or percentages) can be supplied at same time.

SpecificLandUse always has a constant cardinality of 1, only one specific value can be supplied. However specificPresence works similarity than hilucsPresence.

The two attributes 'percentage' are given for both the hilucsPresence and the specificPresence as it is not expected that the Member States will redraw the ExistingLandUseObject limits. These are voidable as it may exist real situation where multiple uses exist in a given area without knowing their relative importance.

The extent of an ExistingLandUseDataset is defined as the boundary of the union of all the polygons (ExistingLandUseObject) that are a member of the ExistingLandUseDataset (see Figure 19)

image::./media/image31.png[image,width=474,height=516, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 19 – the dotted line defines the Extent of an ExistingLandUseDataset*

====== Sampled Land Use

The Sampled _Land Use_ application schema (see Figure 20) corresponds to a dataset that depicts the reality of the land surface at discrete location on the earth. Often these datasets are collected for statistical purposes to provide estimates of land use over wider areas.

The «featureType» SampledExistingLandUseDataset contains the LandUseSample that corresponds to a location which land use information is gathered at.

A SampledExistingLandUseDataset may correspond to surveys done at different moment. Thus each LandUseSample may be associated with the time when the survey has been performed (attribute observationDate of «featureType» LandUseSample in Figure 20).

The Sampled _Land Use_ application schema enables the provision of information on other land uses besides the dominant land use at the surveyed location. The LandUseSample may be associated with 1 to many hilucsLandUse, 0 to many «dataType» hilucsPresence, 1 to many specificLandUse and 0 to many «dataType» specificPresence. That will enable to provide importances and percentages in similar way than for Existing _Land Use_. The same four situations are identified (see Table 3 in 5.3.1.1.2).

image::./media/image32.png[image,width=604,height=245, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 20 – UML Overview of the Sampled _Land Use_ application schema*

The extent of a SampledExistingLandUseDataset is defined as the convex hull that includes all the locations which land use information is gathered at (ExistingLandUseSample (see Figure 21)

image::./media/image33.jpeg[NewExtentSELU,width=468,height=351]

*Figure 21 – the dotted line defines the Extent of an SampledExistingLandUseDataset*

====== Gridded Land Use

The gridded land use application schema corresponds to a dataset that depicts land use with pixels, each pixel being associated with 1 hilucspresence or (exclusive) 1 specificPresence (see Figure 22 where range in the NOTE expresses the way this association is done).

The pixels are grouped in a coverage («featureType» LandUseGridCoverage in the UML overview in Figure 22). Coverage («featureType» CoverageByDomainAndRange::RectifiedGridCoverage) inherits the properties from the coverage as described in section 5.2.8. Only the GridCoverage subtypes of CoverageByDomainAndRange is permitted.

[IMPORTANT]
====

*IR Requirement*

* MultiPointCoverage: coverage characterized by a finite domain consisting of points. Usually the
* GridCoverage : coverage whose domain consists of a collection of grid points

image::./media/image34.png[image,width=570,height=458, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 22 – UML Overview of the gridded land use coverage*

====== Planned land use

The planned land use conceptual schema (see Figure 23) corresponds to a dataset that corresponds to a spatial planning document. Geographical information as well as the informative or descriptive parts contained in a spatial planning documents are taken into consideration in the _Land Use_ data application schema. Only the spatial planning documents that are or have to be legally adopted by an authority and are opposable to third parties are considered within INSPIRE.

A spatial planning document corresponds to the «featureType» SpatialPlan. It has specific attributes such as its name (planTypeName) and the level of the administrative hierarchy it has been adopted in (levelOfSpatialPlan). It is possible to attach other information such as the legislation reference or the date and reference of the legal act that make it entering into force (see UML overview in Figure 23).

The concept of zoning is part of Planned _Land Use_ in many countries. The zoning is composed of polygons that are mutually exclusive. Zoning provides regulation on how LandUse can evolve. The «featureType» SpatialPlan contains the «featureType» ZoningElement which allow expressing the land use that the administrative authority plans through its attribute hilucsLandUse. ZoningElements have several specific attributes such as the nature of the regulation (regulationNature), indications on dimension rules that apply to the use of land and reference to the applicable regulation.The zoning elements are always viewed as polygons.

The nomenclature provides information on the type of land use that is permitted or forbidden inside each zoning element.

The attribute hilucsLandUse has a multiplicity of 1 to many because planners on the one hand reserve areas for the future installation of economic activities not knowing a priori which activities will be installed and on the other hand they more and more create areas for "non-conflicting" activities or "mixed zones". Thus providing several hilucsLandUse values enables to provide the list of HILUCSValue that may apply to a ZoningElement.

Where in a SpatialPlan, areas are not subject to zoning, it is up to the data provider to decide on one of the following solutions:

* consider the area as a "hole"
* consider the area as a ZoningElement with the HILUCS code corresponding to "notKnownLandUse"

image::./media/image35.png[image,width=590,height=563, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 23 – UML Overview of the Planned _Land Use_ application schema*

_Supplementary regulation_

Supplementary information is often present in spatial planning document and delimits locations where a specific regulation applies and supplements the regulations of the zoning. These supplementary regulations may be seen as a buffer around an object of the real world. A point or a line can bear the regulation. This supplementary information is implemented in the «featureType» SupplementaryRegulation.

For any given point within a SpatialPlan, the intended land use is given by the attributes of the Zon-ingElement it falls into. The FeatureType SupplementaryRegulation must be used if any intention or limitation also exists at this point.

A specific nomenclature indicates the types of Supplementary Regulations that may exist in the spatial plan. It is country-dependant as it directly links to legal articles. The application schema enables the documentation of the fact that a Supplementary Regulation exists at a certain location and allows to connect to the description on how it affects the land use via country-dependant mechanism. These Supplementary Regulations vary in nature inside any spatial plan.

Figure 24 illustrates Supplementary Regulations that may exist over a given area. The type of supplementary regulations is given by the attributes supplementaryRegulation (with values from a hierarchical supplementary regulation code list managed within INSPIRE) and localSupplementaryRegulation of the «featureType» SupplementaryRegulation (with values from a local code list). Mapping the equivalence between these values should be provided by data producers. Further work is though needed for achieving a European harmonisation on that matter; annex E provides the proposed hierarchical INSPIRE supplementary regulation code list (HSRCL).

NOTE1: by extension, any point or line that in a spatial plan provides information related to HILUCS should be modelled as a SupplementaryRegulation with the code corresponding to "other supplementary regulation" in the HSRCL.

NOTE2: Any information related to the use of the underground should be modelled as a SupplementaryRegulation.

NOTE3: Planned land use incorporate elements that in the real world can be related to other INSPIRE spatial data themes such as Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units (AM, Annex III theme 11) or Natural Risk Zones (NZ, annex III theme 12). These will be seen as supplementary regulation in the _Land Use_ data model (planned land Use) as soon as this information is incorporated in the legal spatial plan, i.e. only information that is geographical and legally binding in the spatial plan will be considered as a supplementary regulation although it may belong to another theme. For example, any Restriction/Regulation Zone that is not explicitly incorporated in a spatial plan belongs to the AM theme, and any Restriction/Regulation Zone that is incorporated in a spatial plan (i.e. whose geometry and attributes are included in the "paper form" spatial plan) will be modelled as supplementary regulation.

*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV Section 4.8_
*Theme specific requirements*

Where a zone has been established to regulate planned land use and defined within a legally binding spatial plan, it falls within the scope of the _Land Use_ theme and shall be encoded as a SupplementaryRegulation. However, if the zone has been established by legislative requirement but not defined within a legally binding spatial plan, then it shall be encoded as a ManagementRestrictionOrRegulationZone.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 9*

The codelist for SupplementaryRegulation (see annex C) is a first draft. It is recommended that Member states start the process of mapping their national code list with the proposed one and that a working party be established at the European level to make progress towards an improved European code list for supplementary regulations (HSRCL).

_Other aspects_

Planned land use datasets are specific as they correspond to legal documents containing the regulations. The application schema implements the requirement to include inside the dataset the digital facsimile of the regulation («dataType» DocumentCitation). But the regulation itself may be attached to the spatial plan as well as to any Zoning Element or to any Supplementary Regulations. The «featureType» OfficialDocumentation implements that requirement. OffcialDocumentation can either be the text itself, the reference to the official journal that contains it or the URL of the document that contains it.

The scanned version of any maps included in spatial planning documents may also be associated to the spatial plan («dataType» DocumentCitation). The objective for the provision of scanned map is two fold:

* allow the provision of the scanned version of the official spatial plan together with the vector SpatialPlan because only the paper based version is the official one in many member states,
* allow the provision of spatial plans in digital form where no vector data exists.

The attribute planDocument of the feature type OfficialDocumentation must be used to provide scanned version of a spatial plan either as text, image or georeferenced image. The MIME extension should be used to inform on its format.

The PLU application schema also accommodates the situation where several spatial plans have already been aggregated into a single dataset as well as situation where several spatial plan has been aggregated into a single spatial plan itself being a single dataset.

The extent of a SpatialPlan is defined as the limit of the union of all the ZoningElements and the SupplementaryRegulation that are a member of the SpatialPlan (see Figure 25).

*Figure 25 – the dotted line defines the Extent of a SpatialPlan where in blue are the SupplementaryRegulation and in red the ZoningElement*

Where a SpatialPlan only contains the scanned version of a paper map, the extent should be defined as the outer limit of the cartographic image of the spatial plan (see Figure 26)

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

Spatial plans are often drawn on the backdrop of another map (e.g. cadastral parcels or topographic data or orthoimagery). However, the INSPIRE _Planned Land Use_ data specification represents spatial plans as absolute, not relative geometries. That is, they have their own, absolute geometries and their geographical location is not dependent on other features (other than during their original delineation). This is because many Member States do not update their spatial plans if there are changes to the backdrop data, and in any case, the legal definition of a spatial plan remains fixed even if there are underlying changes to the backdrop data. Metadata may provide information on the backdrop that has been used at the time the spatial plan enters into force.

Existing _Land Use_ data is often collected in combination with Land Cover data and in that case geometries in the two datasets will often be equivalent. Because there is no relationship in INSPIRE between _Land Use_ and Land Cover this consistency will not be enforced.

It can be possible that different spatial plans (different datasets), for example of different levels (municipal and regional) or of different times (one from 1970 and one from 2010), are overlapping.

Data providers may solve the sliversfootnote:[Slivers are small polygons generated by overlapping two adjacent plans where the same line in reality has a different geometry in each dataset.] between adjacent spatial plans if they provide such a combined data set. If slivers cannot be resolved, it is recommended to provide different datasets. INSPIRE will not thus solve the slivers issues.

At a regional level it is not necessary to take care of municipality borders, in contrast at the municipality level (e.g. preparatory land-use plans for the entire area) zoning elements should not overlay with zoning elements of a neighbouring municipality. It is up to data providers to possibly resolve such slivers. INSPIRE will not provide mechanisms for that level of harmonisation.

Annex I of this document provides example of spatial plans at state level modelled according to the planned land use data application schema.

===== Identifier management

The reason for having INSPIRE identifiers are twofold:

* provide a stable identifier for users to liaise with their own information,
* provide a stable identifier internal to the dataset in order to implement the relationships identified in the application schema.

Regarding ExistingLandUseDataSet and SampledExistingLandUseDataSet, stable identifiers are required when several datasets provide information over the same area but at different date. They ease the construction of how land use evolved through time.

At national level, Spatial plans usually have a unique identifier but sub-elements (e.g. ZoningElement and SupplementaryRegulation) may have identifiers that are only unique within the context of a given dataset. An inspireId can be constructed by combining the identifiers of the plan with the local identifier.

===== Modelling of object references

Spatial plans are legal documents that regulate what developments are allowed, allowed under certain circumstances and not allowed in an area. The various parts of the plan use the OfficialDocumentation object to make references to the legal text or a specific location in the legal document or even to other documents such as scanned versions of the plan.

Furthermore, Spatial Plans can be provided as scanned documents or structural drawing that are not always geo-referencable maps (See Figure 30 as an example).

[.text-center]
*Figure 30 – example of a non-georeferencable map in a spatial plan (Scot Flandre-Dunkerque)*

A link to these documents can be provided via the officialDocumentation association (see Figure 23).

===== Temporality representation

In Existing _Land Use_ the temporal attributes validFrom and validTo are used to indicate when the given object is valid in reality (as opposed to the beginLifespanVersion and endLifespanVersion that gives information on the validity of the object in the system). In many cases this information will not be known: It may be observed that an area has changed from one land use type to another, but not when the change happened. In this case the observationDate can be used to specify when the new type was observed.

In Planned _Land Use_ a SpatialPlan describes the future and it has the attributes validFrom and validTo to define the validity of the SpatialPlan in reality, i.e. the time period during which the rules of the plan are legally valid. For spatial plans the end date of the legal validity may not be known, e.g. when a spatial plan is valid till it is superseded by a more recent plan. In that case the validTo date will have the void value. It is also possible that (part of) a spatial plan is annulled by a legal body. In that case the valid to date will be filled.

The application schemas also are usable for archived datasets although data providers may decide not to provide the corresponding data through INSPIRE.

== Reference systems, units of measure and grids

=== Default reference systems, units of measure and grid

The reference systems, units of measure and geographic grid systems included in this sub-section are the defaults to be used for all INSPIRE data sets, unless theme-specific exceptions and/or additional requirements are defined in section 6.2.

==== Coordinate reference systems

===== Datum

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.2_
*Datum for three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems*

For the three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems and the horizontal component of compound coordinate reference systems used for making spatial data sets available, the datum shall be the datum of the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) in areas within its geographical scope, or the datum of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) or other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with ITRS in areas that are outside the geographical scope of ETRS89. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of the ITRS and there is a well documented relationship between both systems, according to EN ISO 19111.

===== Coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.3_
*Coordinate Reference Systems*

Spatial data sets shall be made available using at least one of the coordinate reference systems specified in sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, unless one of the conditions specified in section 1.3.4 holds.

*1.3.1. Three-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.

* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.


*1.3.2. Two-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate reference system.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Transverse Mercator coordinate reference system.


*1.3.3. Compound Coordinate Reference Systems*

1. For the horizontal component of the compound coordinate reference system, one of the coordinate reference systems specified in section 1.3.2 shall be used.

2. For the vertical component, one of the following coordinate reference systems shall be used:

* For the vertical component on land, the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) shall be used to express gravity-related heights within its geographical scope. Other vertical reference systems related to the Earth gravity field shall be used to express gravity-related heights in areas that are outside the geographical scope of EVRS.

* For the vertical component in the free atmosphere, barometric pressure, converted to height using ISO 2533:1975 International Standard Atmosphere, or other linear or parametric reference systems shall be used. Where other parametric reference systems are used, these shall be described in an accessible reference using EN ISO 19111-2:2012.

* For the vertical component in marine areas where there is an appreciable tidal range (tidal waters), the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) shall be used as the reference surface.

* For the vertical component in marine areas without an appreciable tidal range, in open oceans and effectively in waters that are deeper than 200 meters, the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or a well-defined reference level close to the MSL shall be used as the reference surface.


*1.3.4. Other Coordinate Reference Systems*

Exceptions, where other coordinate reference systems than those listed in 1.3.1, 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 may be used, are:

1. Other coordinate reference systems may be specified for specific spatial data themes in this Annex.

_Article 11_
*Temporal Reference Systems*

1. The default temporal reference system referred to in point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (footnote:[OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12.]) shall be used, unless other temporal reference systems are specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE 1 Point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (the INSPIRE Metadata IRs) states that the default reference system shall be the Gregorian calendar, with dates expressed in accordance with ISO 8601.

NOTE 2 ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. The standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears first in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It also provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information across time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

EXAMPLE 1997 (the year 1997), 1997-07-16 (16th July 1997), 1997-07-16T19:20:3001:00 (16th July 1997, 19h 20' 30'', time zone: UTC1)

[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 2.2_
*Grids*

Either of the grids with fixed and unambiguously defined locations defined in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 shall be used as a geo-referencing framework to make gridded data available in INSPIRE, unless one of the following conditions holds:

[arabic, start=1]
. Other grids may be specified for specific spatial data themes in Annexes II-IV. In this case, data exchanged using such a theme-specific grid shall use standards in which the grid definition is either included with the data, or linked by reference.

. For grid referencing in regions outside of continental Europe Member States may define their own grid based on a geodetic coordinate reference system compliant with ITRS and a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, following the same principles as laid down for the grid specified in Section 2.2.1. In this case, an identifier for the coordinate reference system shall be created.

*2.2 Equal Area Grid*

The grid is based on the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (ETRS89-LAEA) coordinate reference system with the centre of the projection at the point 52^o^ N, 10^o^ E and false easting: x~0~ = 4321000 m, false northing: y~0~ = 3210000 m.

The origin of the grid coincides with the false origin of the ETRS89-LAEA coordinate reference system (x=0, y=0).

Grid points of grids based on ETRS89-LAEA shall coincide with grid points of the grid.

The grid is hierarchical, with resolutions of 1m, 10m, 100m, 1000m, 10000m and 100000m.

The grid orientation is south-north, west-east.

The grid is designated as Grid_ETRS89-LAEA. For identification of an individual resolution level the cell size in metres is appended.

For the unambiguous referencing and identification of a grid cell, the cell code composed of the size of the cell and the coordinates of the lower left cell corner in ETRS89-LAEA shall be used. The cell size shall be denoted in metres ("m") for cell sizes up to 100m or kilometres ("km") for cell sizes of 1000m and above. Values for northing and easting shall be divided by 10^n^, where _n_ is the number of trailing zeros in the cell size value.

_Annex IV Section 4.8_
*Theme specific requirements*

Based on the INSPIRE horizontal coordinate reference system, each Member State shall define a projection or a set of projections suitable for working with the underlying cadastral parcels on national territory and cross-border areas where applicable for a SpatialPlan. A projection is suitable if it offers few linear alterations (ideally less than 50 cm per 500 m) and so enables users to measure distances and surfaces in meaningful way. This projection or set of projections has to be defined in agreement with neighbouring countries. This projection or set of projections must be well documented to allow the conversion from and to the common Coordinate Reference System. The documentation shall be provided according to ISO 19111, which states how a projected coordinate reference system must be described.

== Data quality

This chapter includes a description of the data quality elements and sub-elements as well as the corresponding data quality measures that should be used to evaluate and document data quality for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Land Use_ (section 7.1).

It may also define requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Land Use_ (sections 7.2 and 7.3).

In particular, the data quality elements, sub-elements and measures specified in section 7.1 should be used for

* evaluating and documenting data quality properties and constraints of spatial objects, where such properties or constraints are defined as part of the application schema(s) (see section 5);

* evaluating and documenting data quality metadata elements of spatial data sets (see section 8); and/or

* specifying requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Land Use_ (see sections 7.2 and 7.3).


The descriptions of the elements and measures are based on Annex D of ISO/DIS 19157 Geographic information – Data quality.

=== Data quality elements

Table 6 lists all data quality elements and sub-elements that are being used in this specification. Data quality information can be evaluated at level of spatial object, spatial object type, dataset or dataset series. The level at which the evaluation is performed is given in the "Evaluation Scope" column.

The measures to be used for each of the listed data quality sub-elements are defined in the following sub-sections.

*Table 6 – Data quality elements used in the spatial data theme _Land Use_*

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 10*

Where it is impossible to express the evaluation of a data quality element in a quantitative way, the evaluation of the element should be expressed with a textual statement as a data quality descriptive result.

|Description a|
This data quality element is not applicable to SLU or GLU.

For ELU and PLU, the land use features (ExistingLandUseObject and ZoningElement)are mutually exclusive, therefore possible existence of polygons' excess can be managed by topological principles.

This data quality element applies only for SupplementaryRegulation in PLU

|Example a|
HILUCS class 3 "Services" does not exist in the dataset. When the data producer knows that this class occurs in the area the dataset covers he sets the missing item value for this class "true". That indication covers also the sub-classes (3.1, 3.1.1. etc).

HILUCS class 1.2 "Forestry use" data exists in the dataset but the sub-classes 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 do not. Data producer knows that classes 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 exist in the area but 1.2.1 does not. Missing item will have value "true" for HILUCS classes 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 and a value "false" to 1.2.1.

HILUCS class 1.2 "Forestry use" data exists in the dataset but sub-classes 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 do not. Data producer does not know whether there exist sub-classes 1.2.1 - 1.2.3 in the area or not. Values for missing items are not set.

|*Name* |*Mean value of positional uncertainties (2D)*
|Alternative name |_-_
|Data quality element |Positional accuracy
|Data quality sub-element |Absolute or external accuracy
|Data quality basic measure |Not applicable
|Definition |Mean value of the positional uncertainties for a set of positions where the positional uncertainties are defined as the distance between a measured position and what is considered as the corresponding true position.
|Description a|
Element is valid only for land use schemas ELU and PLU. Measurement unit is meters.

For ELU a estimation of positional error in sampled points can be evaluated:

For a number of points (N), the measured positions are given as xmi, ymi and zmi coordinates depending on the dimension in which the position of the point is measured. A corresponding set of coordinates, xti, yti and zti, are considered to represent the true positions. The errors are calculated as

image::./media/image43.png[image,width=167,height=36, align=center]

[.text-center]
The mean positional uncertainties of the horizontal absolute or external positions is then calculated as

image::./media/image44.png[image,width=77,height=44, align=center]

[.text-center]
A criterion for the establishing of correspondence should also be stated (e.g. allowing for correspondence to the closest position, correspondence on vertices or along lines, etc.). The criterion/criteria for finding the corresponding points shall be reported with the data quality evaluation result.

NOTE This data quality measure is different than the standard deviation.

For PLU (polygons) the positional accuracy is portrayed as an estimated value based to the scale of the data as follows:

[cols=",",options="header",]

== Dataset-level metadata

This section specifies dataset-level metadata elements, which should be used for documenting metadata for a complete dataset or dataset series.

NOTE Metadata can also be reported for each individual spatial object (spatial object-level metadata). Spatial object-level metadata is fully described in the application schema(s) (section 5).

For some dataset-level metadata elements, in particular those for reporting data quality and maintenance, a more specific scope can be specified. This allows the definition of metadata at sub-dataset level, e.g. separately for each spatial object type (see instructions for the relevant metadata element).

=== Metadata elements defined in INSPIRE Metadata Regulation

Table 8 gives an overview of the metadata elements specified in Regulation 1205/2008/EC (implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata).

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to the relevant section in the Metadata Regulation, which contains a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.
* The fourth column specifies the condition, under which the given element becomes mandatory.

Generic guidelines for implementing these elements using ISO 19115 and 19119 are available at http:/_/inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101_. The following sections describe additional theme-specific recommendations and requirements for implementing these elements.

==== Conformity

The _Conformity_ metadata element defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC requires to report the conformance with the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services. In addition, it may be used also to document the conformance to another specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 18*

Dataset metadata should include a statement on the overall conformance of the dataset with this data specification (i.e. conformance with all requirements).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 19*

The _Conformity_ metadata element should be used to document conformance with this data specification (as a whole), with a specific conformance class defined in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A and/or with another specification.

====

The _Conformity_ element includes two sub-elements, the _Specification_ (a citation of the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services or other specification), and the _Degree_ of conformity. The _Degree_ can be _Conformant_ (if the dataset is fully conformant with the cited specification), _Not Conformant_ (if the dataset does not conform to the cited specification) or _Not Evaluated_ (if the conformance has not been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 20*

If a dataset is not yet conformant with all requirements of this data specification, it is recommended to include information on the conformance with the individual conformance classes specified in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 21*
If a dataset is produced or transformed according to an external specification that includes specific quality assurance procedures, the conformity with this specification should be documented using the _Conformity_ metadata element.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 22*
If minimum data quality recommendations are defined then the statement on the conformity with these requirements should be included using the _Conformity_ metadata element and referring to the relevant data quality conformance class in the Abstract Test Suite.

====

NOTE Currently no minimum data quality requirements are included in the IRs. The recommendation above should be included as a requirement in the IRs if minimum data quality requirements are defined at some point in the future.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 23*
When documenting conformance with this data specification or one of the conformance classes defined in the Abstract Test Suite, the _Specification_ sub-element should be given using the http URI identifier of the conformance class or using a citation including the following elements:

* title: "INSPIRE Data Specification on _Land Use_ – Technical Guidelines – <name of the conformance class>"

* date:
** dateType: publication
** date: 2013-04-10

==== Lineage

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 24*

Following the ISO/DIS 19157 Quality principles, if a data provider has a procedure for the quality management of their spatial data sets then the appropriate data quality elements and measures defined in ISO/DIS 19157 should be used to evaluate and report (in the metadata) the results. If not, the _Lineage_ metadata element (defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC) should be used to describe the overall quality of a spatial data set.

====

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, lineage "is a statement on process history and/or overall quality of the spatial data set. Where appropriate it may include a statement whether the data set has been validated or quality assured, whether it is the official version (if multiple versions exist), and whether it has legal validity. The value domain of this metadata element is free text".

The Metadata Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119 specifies that the statement sub-element of LI_Lineage (EN ISO 19115) should be used to implement the lineage metadata element.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 25*

To describe the transformation steps and related source data, it is recommended to use the following sub-elements of LI_Lineage:

- For the description of the transformation process of the local to the common INSPIRE data structures, the LI_ProcessStep sub-element should be used.

- For the description of the source data the LI_Source sub-element should be used.

====

NOTE 1 In order to improve the interoperability, domain templates and instructions for using these free text elements (descriptive statements) may be specified here and/or in an Annex of this data specification.

==== Temporal reference

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, at least one of the following temporal reference metadata sub-elements shall be provided: temporal extent, date of publication, date of last revision, date of creation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 26*

It is recommended that at least the date of the last revision of a spatial data set should be reported using the _Date of last revision_ metadata sub-element.

====

==== Keywords

Keywords are used to classify resource to facilitate effective discovery and thematic discovery. The keyword value is a commonly used word, formalised word or phrase used to describe the subject and thus help narrowing a full text search and they allow for structured keyword search.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV Section 4.8_
*Theme specific requirements*

Data providers shall include the following keywords in addition to the mandatory keywords defined in Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008/EC:

[loweralpha]
. One of the following language-neutral keywords to describe the type of land use data set: ExistingLandUse, SampledExistingLandUse, GriddedExistingLandUse, PlannedLandUse.

. If the data set contains SpatialPlan objects, one keyword describing the level of the administrative units covered by the plan, as defined in the LevelOfSpatialPlan code list.
====

==== Spatial Resolution

Guidelines may provide further information on how to use common metadata

elements or how to restrict the use of common metadata elements according

to the metadata regulation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV Section 4.8_
*Theme specific requirements*

The use of the common metadata element "Spatial Resolution" (according to Section 6.2 of part B of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008) shall be restricted to providing a resolution distance.

====

NOTE The "minimum unit of interest" concept directly indicated the size of the smallest polygonal area for _Land Use_ types to be found in the dataset. That information is transferred to the user via the "spatial resolution" MD-element and may be dependent on HILUCS categories.

=== Metadata elements for interoperability

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 13
*Metadata required for Interoperability*

The metadata describing a spatial data set shall include the following metadata elements required for interoperability:

. Coordinate Reference System: Description of the coordinate reference system(s) used in the data set.

. Temporal Reference System: Description of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.

. Encoding: Description of the computer language construct(s) specifying the representation of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device or transmission channel.

. Topological Consistency: Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the data set as described by the scope.
+
This element is mandatory only if the data set includes types from the Generic Network Model and does not assure centreline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for the network.

. Character Encoding: The character encoding used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if an encoding is used that is not based on UTF-8.

. Spatial Representation Type: The method used to spatially represent geographic information.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to implement the required metadata elements based on ISO 19115 and ISO/TS 19139.

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with the proposed encoding.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 2*
Metadata instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the used ISO 19139 XML schema.

====

NOTE Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 3*
Metadata instance (XML) documents shall contain the elements and meet the INSPIRE multiplicity specified in the sections below.

====

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 4*
The elements specified below shall be available in the specified ISO/TS 19139 path.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 27*

The metadata elements for interoperability should be made available together with the metadata elements defined in the Metadata Regulation through an INSPIRE discovery service.

====

NOTE While this not explicitly required by any of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, making all metadata of a data set available together and through one service simplifies implementation and usability.

==== Data Quality – Logical Consistency – Topological Consistency

See section 8.3.2 for instructions on how to implement metadata elements for reporting data quality.

=== Recommended theme-specific metadata elements

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 28*

The metadata describing a spatial data set or a spatial data set series related to the theme _Land Use_ should comprise the theme-specific metadata elements specified in Table 9.

====

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.

==== Metadata elements for reporting data quality

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 30*

For reporting the results of the data quality evaluation, the data quality elements, sub-elements and (for quantitative evaluation) measures defined in chapter 7 should be used.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 31*

The metadata elements specified in the following sections should be used to report the results of the data quality evaluation. At least the information included in the row "Implementation instructions" should be provided.

====

The first section applies to reporting quantitative results (using the element DQ_QuantitativeResult), while the second section applies to reporting non-quantitative results (using the element DQ_DescriptiveResult).

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 32*

If a dataset does not pass the tests of the Application schema conformance class (defined in Annex A), the results of each test should be reported using one of the options described in sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2.

====

NOTE 1 If using non-quantitative description, the results of several tests do not have to be reported separately, but may be combined into one descriptive statement.

NOTE 2 The sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2 may need to be updated once the XML schemas for ISO 19157 have been finalised.

The scope for reporting may be different from the scope for evaluating data quality (see section 7). If data quality is reported at the data set or spatial object type level, the results are usually derived or aggregated.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 33*

The scope element (of type DQ_Scope) of the DQ_DataQuality subtype should be used to encode the reporting scope.

Only the following values should be used for the level element of DQ_Scope: Series, Dataset, featureType.

If the level is featureType the levelDescription/MDScopeDescription/features element (of type Set< GF_FeatureType>) shall be used to list the feature type names.

====

NOTE In the level element of DQ_Scope, the value featureType is used to denote spatial object type.

== Delivery

=== Updates

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 8_
*Updates*

. Member States shall make available updates of data on a regular basis.

. All updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set, unless a different period is specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE In this data specification, no exception is specified, so all updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set.

=== Delivery medium

According to Article 11(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for INSPIRE spatial data sets and services. The relevant network service types for making spatial data available are:

* _view services_ making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;
* _download services_, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;
* _transformation services_, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability.

NOTE For the relevant requirements and recommendations for network services, see the relevant Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelinesfootnote:[The Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines on INSPIRE Network Services are available at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/5].

EXAMPLE 1 Through the Get Spatial Objects function, a download service can either download a pre-defined data set or pre-defined part of a data set (non-direct access download service), or give direct access to the spatial objects contained in the data set, and download selections of spatial objects based upon a query (direct access download service). To execute such a request, some of the following information might be required:

* the list of spatial object types and/or predefined data sets that are offered by the download service (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation),
* and the query capabilities section advertising the types of predicates that may be used to form a query expression (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation, where applicable),
* a description of spatial object types offered by a download service instance (to be provided through the Describe Spatial Object Types operation).

EXAMPLE 2 Through the Transform function, a transformation service carries out data content transformations from native data forms to the INSPIRE-compliant form and vice versa. If this operation is directly called by an application to transform source data (e.g. obtained through a download service) that is not yet conformant with this data specification, the following parameters are required:

Input data (mandatory). The data set to be transformed.

* Source model (mandatory, if cannot be determined from the input data). The model in which the input data is provided.
* Target model (mandatory). The model in which the results are expected.
* Model mapping (mandatory, unless a default exists). Detailed description of how the transformation is to be carried out.

=== Encodings

The IRs contain the following two requirements for the encoding to be used to make data available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 7_
*Encoding*

1. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall conform to EN ISO 19118. In particular, it shall specify schema conversion rules for all spatial object types and all attributes and association roles and the output data structure used.

2. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall be made available.

====

NOTE ISO 19118:2011 specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules used for interchange of geographic data within the set of International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". An encoding rule allows geographic information defined by application schemas and standardized schemas to be coded into a system-independent data structure suitable for transport and storage. The encoding rule specifies the types of data being coded and the syntax, structure and coding schemes used in the resulting data structure. Specifically, ISO 19118:2011 includes

* requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas,
* requirements for creating encoding services, and
* requirements for XML-based encoding rules for neutral interchange of data.

While the IRs do not oblige the usage of a specific encoding, these Technical Guidelines propose to make data related to the spatial data theme _Land Use_ available at least in the default encoding(s) specified in section 0. In this section, a number of TG requirements are listed that need to be met in order to be conformant with the default encoding(s).

The proposed default encoding(s) meet the requirements in Article 7 of the IRs, i.e. they are conformant with ISO 19118 and (since they are included in this specification) publicly available.

==== Default Encoding(s)

===== Specific requirements for GML encoding

This data specification proposes the use of GML as the default encoding, as recommended in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of [DS-D2.7]. GML is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118, as required in Article 7(1). For details, see [ISO 19136], and in particular Annex E (UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules).

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with GML encodings.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 5*
Data instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the provided XML schema.

====

NOTE 1 Not all constraints defined in the application schemas can be mapped to XML. Therefore, the following requirement is necessary.

NOTE 2 The obligation to use only the allowed code list values specified for attributes and most of the constraints defined in the application schemas cannot be mapped to the XML sch. They can therefore not be enforced through schema validation. It may be possible to express some of these constraints using other schema or rule languages (e.g. Schematron), in order to enable automatic validation.

For coverages, different encodings may be used for the domain and the range of the coverage. There are several options for packaging the domain and range encoding when delivering coverage data through a download service, as discussed belowfootnote:[Further details and examples will be included in a future version of the Guidelines for the encoding of spatial data [DS-D2.7].].

*Multipart representation*

For performance reasons, binary file formats are usually preferred to text-based formats such as XML for storing large amounts of coverage data. However, they cannot directly constitute an alternative to pure GML, since their own data structure might often not support all the ISO 19123 elements used to describe coverages in the conceptual model.

The OGC standard GML Application Schema for coverages [OGC 09-146r2] offers a format encoding which combines these two approaches. The first part consists of a GML document representing all coverage components except the range set, which is contained in the second part in some other encoding format such as 'well known' binary formats'. Some information in the second part may be redundant with the GML content of the first part. In this case, consistency must be necessarily ensured, for example by defining a GML mapping of the additional encoding format.

The advantage of this multipart representation is that coverage constituents are not handled individually but as a whole. This is not really the case with GML which also allows the encoding of the value side of the coverage in external binary files, but via references to remote locations.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 6*
Coverage data encoded as multipart messages shall comply with the multipart representation conformance class defined in GML Application Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2].

====

NOTE The GML Application Schema for Coverages establishes a one-to-one relationship between coverages and multipart document instances.

*Reference to an external file*

The range set can be encoded within the XML structure as an external binary file using the gml:File element. This has the benefit of efficiently storing the range set data within an external file that is of a well-known format type, for example TIFF or GeoTIFF. This method of encoding is of most use for the storage of large files.

*Encoding the range inline*

This option encodes the range set data within the XML inline. This is encoded as a DataBlock element. This encoding provides much greater visibility for the range set values, however, this comes at the cost of reduced efficiency. This method of encoding would therefore only be suitable for small datasets.

*Encoding the domain inside a JPEG 2000 file*

This option consists in packaging all the components of one or several coverages, including the domain expressed in GML, in a single JPEG 2000 file. It is based on the OGC standard GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery [OGC 05-047r2], also known as GMLJP2, which specifies how to use GML within the XML boxes of JPEG 2000 files.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 7*
Coverage data encoded in standalone JPEG 2000 files shall comply with the OGC standard GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery [OGC 05-047r2].

====

TG Requirement 7 implies that all the encoding rules presented in GMLJP2 shall be strictly followed for including GML within JPEG 2000 data files correctly. For the sake of harmonization, the encoding rules adopted for the multipart message encoding should also apply to the GMLJP2 encoding.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 34*
The encoding of coverage components in GMLJP2 within a JPEG 2000 file should conform to the rules specified in the Guidelines for the encoding of spatial data [DS-D2.7].

== Data Capture

There is no specific guidance required with respect to data capture.

<<<
== Portrayal

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for this theme. Portrayal is regulated in Article 14 of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

[arabic, start=1]
. For the portrayal of spatial data sets using a view network service as specified in Commission Regulation No 976/2009 (footnote:[OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9.]), the following shall be available:
+
[loweralpha]
.. the layers specified in Annex II for the theme or themes the data set is related to;
.. for each layer at least a default portrayal style, with as a minimum an associated title and a unique identifier.

[arabic, start=2]
. For each layer, Annex II defines the following:
+
[loweralpha]
.. a human readable title of the layer to be used for display in user interface;
.. the spatial object type(s), or sub-set thereof, that constitute(s) the content of the layer.

====

In section 11.1, the _types_ of layers are defined that are to be used for the portrayal of the spatial object types defined in this specification. A view service may offer several layers of the same type, one for each dataset that it offers data on a specific topic.

NOTE The layer specification in the IRs only contains the name, a human readable title and the (subset(s) of) spatial object type(s), that constitute(s) the content of the layer. In addition, these Technical Guidelines suggest keywords for describing the layer.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 35*
It is recommended to use the keywords specified in section 11.1 in the _Layers Metadata parameters_ of the INSPIRE View service (see Annex III, Part A, section 2.2.4 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009).

====

Section 11.2 specifies one style for each of these layers. It is proposed that INSPIRE view services support this style as the default style required by Article 14(1b).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 8*
For each layer specified in this section, the styles defined in section 11.2 shall be available.

====

NOTE The default style should be used for portrayal by the view network service if no user-defined style is specified in a portrayal request for a specific layer.

In section 11.3, further styles can be specified that represent examples of styles typically used in a thematic domain. It is recommended that also these styles should be supported by INSPIRE view services, where applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation 36*
In addition, it is recommended that, where applicable, INSPIRE view services also support the styles defined in section 11.3.

====

Where XML fragments are used in the following sections, the following namespace prefixes apply:

* sld="http://www.opengis.net/sld" (WMS/SLD 1.1)
* se="http://www.opengis.net/se" (SE 1.1)
* ogc="http://www.opengis.net/ogc" (FE 1.1)

[appendix]
== Abstract Test Suite - (normative) 


*Disclaimer*

While this Annex refers to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services, it does not replace the legal act or any part of it.


The objective of the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) included in this Annex is to help the conformance testing process. It includes a set of tests to be applied on a data set to evaluate whether it fulfils the requirements included in this data specification and the corresponding parts of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010 (implementing rule as regards interoperability of spatial datasets and services, further referred to as ISDSS Regulation). This is to help data providers in declaring the conformity of a data set to the "degree of conformity, with implementing rules adopted under Article 7(1) of Directive 2007/2/EC", which is required to be provided in the data set metadata according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2008/1205 (the Metadata Regulation).

*Part 1* of this ATS includes tests that provide *input for assessing conformity with the ISDSS regulation.* In order to make visible which requirements are addressed by a specific test, references to the corresponding articles of the legal act are given. The way how the cited requirements apply to lu specification is described under the testing method.

In addition to the requirements included in ISDSS Regulation this Technical guideline contains TG requirements too. TG requirements are technical provisions that need to be fulfilled in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement when the specific technical implementation proposed in this document is used. Such requirements relate for example to the default encoding described in section 9. *Part 2* of the ATS presents tests necessary for assessing the *conformity with TG requirements*.

NOTE Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in this ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

The *ATS is applicable to the data sets that* *have been transformed* to be made available through INSPIRE download services (i.e. the data returned as a response to the mandatory "Get Spatial Dataset" operation) rather than the original "source" data sets.

The requirements to be tested are grouped in several _conformance classes_. Each of these classes covers a specific aspect: one conformance class contains tests reflecting the requirements on the application schema, another on the reference systems, etc. *Each conformance class is identified by a URI* (uniform resource identifier) according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/lu/<conformance class identifier>

EXAMPLE 1 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ef/rs_ identifies the Reference Systems ISDSS conformance class of the Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF) data theme.

The results of the tests should be published referring to the relevant conformance class (using its URI).

When an INSPIRE data specification contains *more than one application schema,* the requirements tested in a conformance class may differ depending on the application schema used as a target for the transformation of the data set. This will always be the case for the application schema conformance class. However, also other conformance classes could have different requirements for different application schemas. In such cases, a separate conformance class is defined for each application schema, and they are distinguished by specific URIs according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/lu/<conformance class identifier>/ 
<application schema namespace prefix>

EXAMPLE 2 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/el/as/el-vec_ identifies the conformity with the application schema (_as_) conformance class for the Elevation Vector Elements (_el-vec_) application schema.

An overview of the conformance classes and the associated tests is given in the table below.

In order to be conformant to a conformance class, a data set has to pass *all* tests defined for that conformance class.

In order to be conformant with the ISDSS regulation the inspected data set needs to be conformant to *all* conformance classes in Part 1. The conformance class for overall conformity with the ISDSS regulation is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/lu/._

In order to be conformant with the Technical Guidelines, the dataset under inspection needs to be conformant to all conformance classes included both in Part 1 and 2. Chapter 8 describes in detail how to publish the result of testing regarding overall conformity and conformity with the conformance classes as metadata. The conformance class for overall conformity with the Technical Guidelines is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/tg/lu/3.0._

It should be noted that data providers are not obliged to integrate / decompose the original structure of the source data sets when they deliver them for INSPIRE. It means that a conformant dataset can contain less or more spatial object / data types than specified in the ISDSS Regulation.

*A dataset that contains less spatial object and/or data types* can be regarded conformant when the corresponding types of the source datasets after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation.

A *dataset that contain more spatial object and/or data types* may be regarded as conformant when

* all the spatial object / data types that have corresponding types in the source dataset after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation and
* all additional elements of the source model (spatial object types, data types, attributes, constraints, code lists and enumerations together with their values) do not conflict with any rule defined in the interoperability target specifications defined for any theme within INSPIRE.

|===

*Open Issue 2:* Even though the last condition can be derived from Art. 8(4) of the Directive, the ISDSS Regulation does not contain requirements concerning the above issue. Therefore, no specific tests have been included in this abstract suite for testing conformity of extended application schemas. Annex F of the Generic Conceptual Model (D2.5) provides an example how to extend INSPIRE application schemas in a compliant way.

|===

The ATS contains a detailed list of abstract tests. It should be noted that some tests in the Application schema conformance class can be automated by utilising xml *schema validation tools.* It should be noted that failing such validation test does not necessary reflect non-compliance to the application schema; it may be the results of erroneous encoding.

Each test in this suite follows the same structure:

* Requirement: citation from the legal texts (ISDSS requirements) or the Technical Guidelines (TG requirements);
* Purpose: definition of the scope of the test;
* Reference: link to any material that may be useful during the test;
* Test method: description of the testing procedure.

According to ISO 19105:2000 all tests in this ATS are basic tests. Therefore, this statement is not repeated each time.

=== Application Schema Conformance Class

*Conformance class:*
http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/lu/as/_Land Use_

==== Schema element denomination test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether each element of the dataset under inspection carries a name specified in the target application schema(s).

b) [underline]#Reference#: Art. 3 and Art.4 of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

c) [underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether the corresponding elements of the source schema (spatial object types, data types, attributes, association roles, code lists, and enumerations) are mapped to the target schema with the correct designation of mnemonic names.

NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Value type test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether all attributes or association roles use the corresponding value types specified in the application schema(s).

b) [underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4, Art.6(1), Art.6(4), Art.6(5) and Art.9(1)of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

c) [underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether the value type of each provided attribute or association role adheres to the corresponding value type specified in the target specification.

NOTE 1 This test comprises testing the value types of INSPIRE identifiers, the value types of attributes and association roles that should be taken from enumeration and code lists, and the coverage domains.

NOTE 2 Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Value test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether all attributes or association roles whose value type is a code list or enumeration take the values set out therein.

b) [underline]#Reference#: Art.4 (3) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

c) [underline]#Test Method#: When an attribute / association role has an enumeration or code list as its type, compare the values of each instance with those provided in the application schema. To pass this tests any instance of an attribute / association role

* Shall not take any other value than defined in the enumeration table when its type is an enumeration.

* Shall take only values explicitly specified in the code list when the code list's extensibility is "none".

* Shall take only a value explicitly specified in the code list or shall take a value that is narrower (i.e. more specific) than those explicitly specified in the application schema when the code list's extensibility is "narrower".

* Any _Land Use_ data sets shall assign to each polygon, pixel or location a land use type from the HILUCS at the most appropriate and detailed level of the hierarchy.


NOTE 1 This test is not applicable to code lists with extensibility "open" or "any".

NOTE 2 When a data provider only uses code lists with narrower (more specific values) this test can be fully performed based on internal information.

==== Attributes/associations completeness test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether each instance of spatial object type and data types include all attributes and association roles as defined in the target application schema.

b) [underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4(1), Art.4(2), and Art.5(2) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

c) [underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether all attributes and association roles defined for a spatial object type or data type are present for each instance in the dataset.

NOTE 1 Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

NOTE 2 For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided if it exists in or applies to the real world entity – either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ If the characteristic described by the attribute or association role does not exist in or apply to the real world entity, the attribute or association role does not need to be present in the data set.

==== Abstract spatial object test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the dataset does NOT contain abstract spatial object / data types defined in the target application schema(s).

b) [underline]#Reference#: Art.5(3) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

c) [underline]#Test Method#: Examine that there are NO instances of abstract spatial object / data types in the dataset provided.

NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Constraints test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the instances of spatial object and/or data types provided in the dataset adhere to the constraints specified in the target application schema(s).

b) [underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4(1), and Art.4(2) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

c) [underline]#Test Method#: Examine all instances of data for the constraints specified for the corresponding spatial object / data type. Each instance shall adhere to all constraints specified in the target application schema(s).


Examine if the spatial object type CoverageByDomainAndRange is provided and if is a subtype of GridCoverage.


NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== This test should include

(2) The spatial object type CoverageByDomainAndRange must only be of subtypes of GridCoverage.

==== Geometry representation test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the value domain of spatial properties is restricted as specified in the Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

b) [underline]#Reference#: Art.12(1), Annex IV Section 4 of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

c) [underline]#Test Method#: Check whether all spatial properties only use 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometric objects that exist in the right 2-, 3- or 4-dimensional coordinate space, and where all curve interpolations respect the rules specified in the reference documents.

NOTE Further technical information is in OGC Simple Feature spatial schema v1.2.1 [06-103r4].

=== Reference Systems Conformance Class

*Conformance class:*

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/lu/rs

==== Datum test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether each instance of a spatial object type is given with reference to one of the (geodetic) datums specified in the target specification.

b) [underline]#Reference#: Annex II Section 1.2 of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

c) [underline]#Test Method#: Check whether each instance of a spatial object type specified in the application schema(s) in section 5 has been expressed using:

* the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) within its geographical scope; or
* the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) for areas beyond the ETRS89 geographical scope; or
* other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with the ITRS. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of ITRS and there is a well-established and described relationship between both systems, according to the EN ISO 19111.

NOTE Further technical information is given in Section 6 of this document.

==== Coordinate reference system test

a) [underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether the two- and three-dimensional coordinate reference systems are used as defined in section 6.

b) [underline]#Reference#: Section 6 of Commission Regulation 1089/2010.

c) [underline]#Test Method#: Inspect whether the horizontal and vertical components of coordinates one of the corresponding coordinate reference system has been:

* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.

* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

* Two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate reference system.

== Use cases - (informative) 

=== Introduction

The use cases section intends to sum up the understanding of the Thematic Working Group on _Land Use_ after having reviewed 47 use cases and 26 reference materials provided by the SDICs and the LMOs and after having conducted interviews to ascertain the user requirements. The objective of a use case is to give a description of situations where land use datasets are required to perform a given task. These use cases are documented in order to understand how the requirements have been filtered in view of designing a conceptual model generic enough to cover potential use cases and simple enough to minimise the burden on the shoulder of data producers and uses.

Sections B2 to B5 identify the use cases considered relevant and express the requirements in broad terms. Four use cases have been selected as representative of those reported by SDICS and LMOs to the land use thematic working group:

* land planning,
* analysis of land consumption,
* ecological network mapping,
* greenhouse inventory reporting.

Users' information collection was sometimes heterogeneous, for these reason these four use cases have been fully documented using the INSPIRE template to reach a harmonization with other themes. Figure 31 provides an overview of the use cases regarding the type of land use that is required, the temporality of the required land use data, (either past, present of future land use) and the type of activities that requires land use data.

image::./media/image49.png[image]

[.text-center]
*Figure 31 – Graphs of use cases study about lands involved, temporal dimension and context of use (framework).*

Four other use cases are also presented although less detailed in section B6: _Land Use_ for environmental impact assessment, _Land Use_ for the flood directive, Statistics for _Land Use_, _Land Use_ for soil management

Sections B7 to B8 sum up the data requirements as resulting from the use case analysis. They are presented for both existing and planned land use. It expresses the main requirements regarding the features that need to be taken into consideration, the nomenclature to be used, the temporal dimension, identifiers, portrayal, metadata and requirements for consistency with other themes. It also identifies requirements that have been omitted mainly due to expected difficulties in meeting them.

The previous 'use cases' presentation are based on the current process of data management, and the resulting requirements imperfectly reflect the real user needs. In practice the users handle the accessible data that are most suitable for their objectives but not necessarily the optimal data that best meet their requirements. In many cases optimal data are not available because they may not exist, have technical limitations or are unaffordable. So a complementary review of actual users' requirements has been used to improve the data specification: the detailed requirements inventory from ICT PSP HLANDATAfootnote:[http://www.hlandata.eu[www.hlandata.eu]] project about creation of value-added services based on Harmonized _Land Use_ and Land Cover Datasets.

As an INSPIRE theme, _Land Use_ belongs to a domain where little standardisation has occurred in Europe. _Land Use_ is also often mixed with Land Cover both in term of available datasets and user requirements.

_Land Use_ is perceived as the actual existing land use as it can be observed in reality as well as the intention of authorities for the future land use expressed via spatial plans.

The Nomenclature issue is one of the key requirements. It is felt important to: on the one hand make progress towards a simple but agreed nomenclature applicable throughout Europe; and on the other hand be able to accommodate local nomenclatures that correspond to local usage and culture.


=== Land Planning

==== Narrative description

Regional/spatial planning is a "scientific discipline, an administrative technique and a policy developed as an interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach directed towards a balanced regional development and the physical organisation of space according to an overall strategyfootnote:[From the European Regional/Spatial Planning Charter adopted in 1983 by CEMAT the European Conference of Ministers responsible for Regional Planning]".

The spatial planning process produces _Land Use_ regulation. Three main steps are usually defined:

* the elaboration step which includes diagnostics of the current situation of a given area and proposed scenarios for its development
* the adoption step that usually involves a democratic discussion on the selected scenario
* the "opposition to third parties" step when the _Land Use_ regulation comes into force and is applicable to any further changes to the physical organisation and use of space.

Once adopted, the _Land Use_ regulation (Spatial Plan) is an instrument to implement the choices regarding the spatial-structural development of a certain area. It orders the land use and is composed of two binding parts: a graphic map that indicates on which area the plan is applied and the belonging textual planning requirements. For the majority of the European countries, with the notable exception of the Netherlands, the spatial plan printed on paper and signed by the appropriate authority is the only document that is "opposable to third parties" its digital form having no legal status.

As far as the elaboration step and the adoption step are concerned, the main _Land Use_ requirement is related to the datasets that describe existing _Land Use_ at present and in the past. The issue is related to the understanding of the driving forces that shaped the land, i.e. understanding why the land looks like it is in the reality. Having the trajectory of the land changes with time allows modelling what land tends to be in the future.

Planned _Land Use_ is the result of the planning process. It provides the graphical and textual regulation that will control the future shaping of the land through the land uses that will be permitted or forbidden.

The usage of Planned _Land Use_ is twofold:

* On the one hand the "land law enforcementfootnote:[application du droit des dols]" (or land right implementation) is the process of delivering the appropriate authorisation needed for constructing a building, a road, a railway, or any human built artefact. The full land use regulation (spatial plan) is required for the process to be fully legal and to minimize the number of disputes. Having access to the digital facsimile of the legal document may avoid going back to the paper. Users are to be identified as the citizen, the architect, the promoter, or any person or organisation that requests the authorisation to build something, but also the entity that instructs and delivers the authorisation.
* On the other hand the "land monitoring study" is the process of understanding the land evolution through time and the effect of land policies on land. The full land use regulation (spatial plan) is not requested, only the graphic map is often required with some degree of simplification. Users are professionals such as land planners, geographers, and decision makers including the elected people.

=== Analysis of land consumption

==== Narrative description

The analysis of land consumption is required in many countries as the urban sprawl operates over the agricultural and natural areas. In some countries, municipalities will have to set objectives limiting the land consumption by urban area with mechanism to monitor the way the objectives are met. In the context of sustainable development where economic, social and environmental concerns are balanced, it is important to evaluate the justification of the land consumption by the urban sprawl. It is thus important to have knowledge of the existing land use and the area where the spatial plans project to open area for settlements and commercial or industrial activities and the like and for new communication links.

Urban sprawl is an intrinsic dimension of urbanization, which underlies the processes of spatial diffusion occurring in most developed countries. As modern cities become more complex also the phenomena of urban sprawl become increasingly faceted and diversified. One major aspect of novelty in the current trends is that sprawl does not only affect the use of land but has also an impact on the social, functional and economic spheres of urban life. It may also extend on different spatial levels, affecting not only cities and their surrounding areas but also whole metropolitan regions. Urban economists tend to examine urban sprawl as the aggregate extent of urban land use or as the average urban land use density. It has been shown that urban sprawl can increase the aggregate urban land use and lower the average land use density while at the same time lowering average commuting travel times and increasing discretionary mobility

In Europe several projects aim at detecting changes in existing land cover/use vector data (e.g. DeCOVER2 is a German project to develop algorithms in that area for updating the ATKIS-DLM digital landscape model of Germany, BNTK biotopes and land use map by the federal agency of environment in Germany). Remote sensing data is often used to do the change detection. Because the input and output datasets use different classifications interoperability knowledge on mapping between classifications using ontologies is required.

The issue is both to detect the changes and to understand for a given parcel from which usage it is turned into a new usage. It is thus an issue where comparison of land use maps over time at the parcel level is important.

Urban sprawl is considered acceptable when the rate of urban sprawling is similar to the population increase.

He can then produce a map and statistics showing how the land use has evolved between the two time slots. Based on the urban nature classes and the population information, the user can assess whether the area has been densified or sprawling regarding the change of population distribution and increase.

=== Ecological network map
==== Narrative description

Ecological network is a system of the most valuable sites, important for protection of threatened species, habitat types, ecological systems or landscapes. Ecological network sites must be relatively close to each other and connected with corridors, which allow them to communicate and exchange species.

In order for ecological network to function, all of its parts must be designated:

* *_Core areas_* – areas with ecological conditions that enable preservation of important ecosystems, habitat types and species;
* *_Corridors_* – features that connect core areas like "bridges", enabling species to migrate and communicate. There are 3 types of corridors:
** Linear corridors – continuous elements distinctively different from the surrounding nature parts and not intensively used (rivers, tree lines, hedges etc.)
** Landscape corridors – landscape belts connecting core areas
** Stepping stone corridors – not continuous in structure but enabling ecological network to function (system of water habitat types important for migratory birds etc.)
* *_Buffer zones_* – protecting ecological network from negative surrounding influences (pollution, drainage etc.);
* *_Restoration areas_* – occasionally it is necessary to restore or re-establish degraded habitat types as parts of ecological network, in order for it to function


image::./media/image54.jpeg[image,width=340,height=340, align=center]

The legal basis of the ecological network programs includes

* NATURA 2000 – Habitat Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC)
* Emerald Network – The Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention)
* National Ecological Network – national nature protection legislation

Ecological networks are structured hierarchically. That means its parts (core areas, corridors, buffer zones and restoration areas) can be distinguished on different levels: International, Regional, National, Local. Each part of the ecological network has a different role depending on the network level. For example, core areas of the local ecological network (small zoological reserve, forest etc.) can be only a part of the higher-level ecological network corridor.

The methodology for creating ecological network is based on the analysis of 'key' (usually threatened) species and habitat types distribution. Starting point for this analysis is a mapping process, which is best to be done using GIS technology. By overlapping species distribution maps, maps of habitat types and maps of protected areas, one can determine areas with highest density of priority species and habitats and evaluate those areas from the nature protection point of view. That way one can determine whether or not those areas are situated within existing boundaries of protected areas; if the boundaries of protected areas are appropriate for biological diversity protection or if they should be modified; if buffer zones around core areas are being created; if corridors for key species communication are being planned and eventually if restoration areas, where needed, are being established.

=== _Land Use_ and land-use change and forestry for greenhouse inventory reporting

==== Narrative description

This Use Case describes shortly the employment of National and International Land Cover and _Land Use_ Changes databases, according to the obligations of UN's FCCCfootnote:[_United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC)_] and Kyoto protocol, with the objective to calculate environmental indicators. LULUCFfootnote:[_Land Use and Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)_] is defined by the UN Climate Change Secretariat as "A greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct human-induced land use, land-use change and forestry activities".

Note: The term '_Land Use_', here can be considered according to two Inspire themes: Land Cover and _Land Use_, because there is a mixture of land cover and land use concepts and terms in UN' FCCC and Kyoto protocol, especially when considering land 'use' changes categories.

Considering the different categories in land use and land use changes for GI according to IPCCfootnote:[_Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)_], in each country it is necessary to select the most appropriate method for identifying and representing land areas as consistently as possible in inventory calculations. These categories and subcategories are described in the Good Practices guidelines for LULUCF and necessary for GHGfootnote:[G__reenhouse Gas (GHG)__] inventory reporting:

* Forest land (F): All land with woody vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define forest land in the national GHG inventory, sub-divided into managed and unmanaged.
* Cropland \(\C\): Arable and tillage land, and agro-forestry systems where vegetation falls below the thresholds used for the forest land category.
* Grassland (G): Range lands and pasture land that is not considered as cropland. It also includes systems with vegetation that fall below the threshold used in the forest land category, without human intervention. It also includes all grassland from wild lands to recreational areas as well as agricultural and silvi-pastoral systems, managed and unmanaged.
* Wetlands (W): Managed and unmanaged land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the year and that does not fall into the forest land, cropland, grassland or settlements categories. It includes reservoirs, rivers and lakes.
* Settlements (S): All developed land, including transportation infrastructure and human settlements of any size.
* Other land (O): It includes bare soil, rock, ice, and all unmanaged land areas that do not fall into any of the other five categories

And the subsequent subcategories defined for in _Land Use_ Changes:

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|FF |forest land remaining forest land |LF |lands converted to forest land
|GG |grassland remaining grassland |LG |lands converted to grassland
|CC |cropland remaining cropland |LC |lands converted to cropland
|WW |wetlands remaining wetlands |LW |lands converted to wetlands
|SS |settlements remaining settlements |LS |lands converted to settlements
|OO |other land remaining other land |LO |lands converted to other land
|===

The way to proceed in each country will be (step by step)

[arabic, start=1]
. Choice of estimation method within the context of the IPCC Guidelines. Where three possible approaches can be identified, depending on availability and accuracy of National GI:
* Use of Basic _Land Use_ data, which can or can not cover the whole territory. It is recommended to have an account of the land data for the different _Land Use_ categories, one for each reference year, but without further explanation of land use changes from one category to another. Only a global flow of gains and losses for each class can be estimated, but no inter-categories changes are identified.
* Survey of _Land Use_ and _Land Use_ change provides a national or regional-scale assessment of inter-categories changes, not only gains and losses. Tracking land use changes in this explicit manner will normally require estimation of initial and final land use categories, as well as of total area of unchanged land by category. The final result of this approach can be presented as a non-spatially explicit land use change matrix.
* Use of geographically explicit land use data. Approach 3 is comprehensive and relatively simple conceptually but data intensive to implement. The target area is subdivided into spatial units such as grid cells or polygons appropriate to the scale of land use variation and the unit size required for sampling or complete enumeration. The spatial units must be used consistently over time or bias will be introduced into the sampling. The spatial units should be sampled using pre-existing map data (usually within GISfootnote:[_Geographic Information System_]) and/or in the field and the land uses should be observed or inferred and recorded at the time intervals required. Observations may be from remote sensing, site visits, oral interviews, or questionnaires. Sampling units may be points or areas from 0.1 ha to a square kilometre or more, depending on the sample design. Units can be sampled statistically on a sparser interval than would be used for the complete coverage, chosen at regular or irregular intervals, and can be concentrated in areas where land use change is expected. _Land Use_ recorded data could be at a point or within a sampling unit, but could also include land use change data within a sampling unit between the sampling years.

[arabic, start=2]
. LULUCF inventory compilation, according to the selected approach for each country. To estimate the land areas in each land use category for time period required, and with these values to assess which non-CO2 gases and carbon pools are significant, and prioritise such pools in terms of methodological choice. Obtaining as result a quantification of emissions and removals. There is abundant number of methodsfootnote:[_Methods documented in "IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF"_] to get these estimation values depending on LU categories and origin of changes, but as general approximation can be interpreted like product of covered surface by each LU category ~ij~ and rates of gains and losses.

image::./media/image57.png[image,width=456,height=164, align=center]

[.text-center]
[arabic, start=3]
. Quality assurance and quality control procedures to provide cross-checks during the inventory compilation. National inventories can have different level of precision, accuracy and levels of bias. Moreover, the estimates are influenced by the quality and consistency of data and information available in a country, as well as gaps in knowledge; the estimations can be affected by different sources of errors. It is good practice to execute quality control checks through Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) procedures. Agencies which collect data are responsible for reviewing the data collection methods, checking the data to ensure that they are collected and aggregated or disaggregated correctly, and cross-checking the data with other data sources and with previous years to ensure that the data are realistic, complete and consistent over time.

[arabic, start=4]
. Documentation of all data and information used, archived and reported to facilitate review and assessment of inventory estimates. Elaborations on pool definition should be reported, and definitions relevant to determining the extent of the managed land included in the inventory, together with evidence that these definitions have been applied consistently over time. Documentation is also needed for demonstrating completeness, consistency of time series data and methods for interpolating between samples and methods for interpolating between samples and years, and for recalculating, and avoidance of double counting as well as for performing QA/QC. The inventory should therefore include summaries of approaches and methods used, and references to source of data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps adopted in their calculation may be retraced.

[arabic, start=5]
. Quantification of uncertainties at the source or sink category level and for the inventory as a whole, so that resources available can be directed toward reducing uncertainties over time, and the improvement can be tracked.

In addition, GPGfootnote:[_Good Practice Guidance_]-LULUCF provides guidance related to the specific features of the LULUCF sector on consistent representation of land areas, sampling for area estimates and for estimating emissions and removals, verification, and guidance on how to complement the Convention reporting for the LULUCF sector to meet the supplementary requirements under the Kyoto Protocol.

=== Other use cases

==== _Land Use_ for environmental impact assessment

An environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an assessment of the possible impact—positive or negative—that a proposed project may have on the environment, together consisting of the natural, social and economic aspects. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made."footnote:["Principle of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice." International Association for Impact Assessment. 1999.][1]. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 14011 covers EIA and includes key steps for carrying out the assessment. As well as direct effects, developments cause a multitude of indirect effects through consumption of goods and services, production of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of various manufacturing and industrial services, mining of resources etc.

==== _Land Use_ for the flood directive

The Floods Directive will be implemented by Member States at the level of River Basin districts/units of management as follows:

* Art 4-5 (Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment) – provide maps of the river basin district at the appropriate scale including the borders of the river basins, sub-basins and, where existing, coastal areas, showing topography and land use (main classes);
* Art 6 (Flood hazard and risk maps). Part of assessment and part of reporting. Maps to be produced at "the appropriate level", according previous assessment maps. Identifying: floods probability, flood extension and inhabitants affected
* Art 7 – Flood risk management plans. _Land Use_ to be taken into account. Measures could include: changed land use, spatial planning measures, set aside of lands

The floods directive requires data on the Existing _Land Use_ relevant for identifying the stakes existing in the risks area, planned land use relevant for potential future stakes (art 4, 5 and 6) and management of risk (art 7). Flood risk management plans and maps may include zoning information but that may differ in member states. No minimum size is fixed. No European LU classification exists for the moment, and it will depend on MS national data.

Requirements include different types of economic activities (referring to NACE or national correlated equivalent codes), knowledge of areas used for flood water storage (temporarily used, permanently set aside for this purpose) and transport routes. Hydrography may include temporarily dry water courses.

For modelling purposes the complete _Land Use_ coverage in a single layer is required (i.e. no overlaps, no gaps, no missing or duplicate polygons).

Temporal information such as the period of the land use plan is required. _Land Use_ changes are useful information for modelling (for example to assess if there is a need to update results derived from modelling and associated risk maps etc.). In terms of degree of dependence it's important to know the actuality of features (date of last update or date its represent the reality).

There is a requirement to relate _Land Use_ elements to potential significant flood risk areas, flooded areas, flood extent areas included in flood maps and planned flood measures.

An identifier would be helpful, for example it should enable to identify which objects from detailed _Land Use_ datasets (provided by mapping agencies) are aggregated to/are part of or are represented by which object(s) in less detailed _Land Use_ dataset like CORINE Land cover.

Consistency with other themes such as Utility and Government Services, Production and Industrial Facilities, Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities, Transport, Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units should be achieved

Differentiating existing _Land Use_ (that exists in reality) from the Planned _Land Use_ (the one authorities are planning to develop) is required. In preliminary assessment of flood risk by determination of areas exposed to flood risk, the impact of future changes in land use in regional scale is taken into consideration in order to evaluate the potential increase/decrease of flood risk.

On flood hazard maps 8 categories of land use elements may be defined: "residential, industrial, communication, forests, parks and recreation, agricultural, water bodies, other". Two additional categories are required : buildings and address points.

The most wanted attribute is the number of people on specific area.

==== Statistics for land use

Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics constitutes the legal basis for the preparation of the European statistical programme, providing the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, the main fields and the objectives of the actions envisaged for a period not exceeding five years. The current programme covers the period 2008-2012. It was established by the Council Decision 1578/2007/EC of 11 December 2007. The five-year programmes are backed up by annual programmes that set more detailed objectives for each year. The following actors are involved: Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the European Commission), (Data provider, data co-ordinator, data user), DG Environment (Data user), DG Agriculture (Data User), DG Enterprise (Data user), European Environment Agency (Data user), Other European Commission services (Data user).

Eurostat collects land cover/use data mainly through the LUCAS survey, which is directly implemented by Eurostat. LUCAS stands for _Land Use_ and Cover Area frame Survey. The aim of the LUCAS survey is to gather harmonised data on land use/cover in the EU countries. In addition the survey provides in-situ information facilitating the analysis of the interactions between land, environment and human activities. In the 2008/2009 LUCAS survey 265,000 geo-referenced points were visited by more than 500 field surveyors on the spot. The points were selected from a standard 2 km grid including in total around 1 million points all over the EU. Land cover and use data is collected from each point according to the LUCAS nomenclature, which consists of a separate land cover nomenclature and of a separate land use nomenclature. In addition the LUCAS database contains approximately 1 million landscape photos and data on agro-environmental features. The final database consists of all surveyed variables on all points. Harmonised land cover and land use statistics are based on this dataset. The data and results are published on Eurostat website and widely used by many Commission services. Eurostat also attempts to collect land cover/use data directly from the Member States. Due to different definitions, classification systems and nomenclatures in the 27 EU Member States this requires a lot of preparatory work in the field of definition and data harmonisation. This is the area where Eurostat will work intensively in the future.

==== _Land Use_ for soil management

Soil is defined as the top layer of the earth's crust. It is formed by mineral particles, organic matter, water, air and living organisms. It is in fact an extremely complex, variable and living medium. The interface between the earth, the air and the water, soil is a non-renewable resource which performs many vital functions: food and other biomass production, storage, filtration and transformation of many substances including water, carbon, nitrogen. Soil has a role as a habitat and gene pool, serves as a platform for human activities, landscape and heritage and acts as a provider of raw materials. These functions are worthy of protection because of their socio-economic as well as environmental importance.

Erosion, loss of organic matter, compaction, salinisation, landslides, contamination, sealing... Soil degradation is accelerating, with negative effects on human health, natural ecosystems and climate change, as well as on our economy. At the moment, only nine EU Member States have specific legislation on soil protection (especially on contamination).

The Commission adopted a Soil Thematic Strategy (COM(2006) 231) and a proposal for a Soil Framework Directive (COM(2006) 232) on 22 September 2006 with the objective to protect soils across the EU. The Strategy and the proposal have been sent to the other European Institutions for the further steps in the decision-making process. The proposed Directive will require Member States to identify risk areas on the basis of common elements to be taken into account, set risk reduction targets for those areas and establish programmes of measures to achieve them.

image::./media/image59.png[image,width=378,height=273, align=center]

On the basis of a common definition of contaminated sites (i.e. sites which pose significant risk to human health and the environment), its application by the Member States, and a common list of potentially polluting activities, Member States will be required by the proposed directive to identify the contaminated sites on their territory and establish a national remediation strategy. In order to achieve a more rational use of soil, Member States will be required to take appropriate measures to limit sealing by rehabilitating brownfield sites and to mitigate its effects by using construction techniques that allow maintaining as many soil functions as possible.

Despite the efforts of several Presidencies, the Council has so far been unable to reach a qualified majority on this legislative proposal due to the opposition of a number of Member States constituting a blocking minority. In general terms, a majority of delegations support a Framework Directive on soil protection. They hold the view that it is needed in order to fill a gap in Union environmental legislation and to provide a more holistic approach to soil protection. This view is also upheld by the Commission. Several delegations, however, remain highly critical of the proposed Directive. These delegations oppose the proposal on grounds of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles, expected costs and administrative burden. Furthermore, they question its added-value in relation to existing Union law.

As far as land use is concerned, erosion, sealing and contaminated sites determination may require knowledge of the Existing _Land Use_ at different time period.

=== Existing land use data requirements

The first step while designing data specifications or products is to identify the final users and their real requirements and needs. These should act as rules during the design phase because they will guarantee the final result usefulness.

The following chapter provides a set of requirements as derived from the INSPIRE users' information collection enriched with experiences gathered in the requirements repository of the ICT PSP HLANDATA project, from a modelling and data specification redaction point of view.

The main objective of the HLANDATA project was to demonstrate the feasibility of a European level harmonization of _Land Use_ and Land Cover datasets taking into account both the data categorization and the data models, for any of their possible uses and users, through the development of user oriented value-added services. After the evaluation and comparison of users' information from HLANDATA project and INSPIRE, the results affirm that both initiatives share a similar users understanding and framework. HLANDATA users' requirements involve tasks carried out in the documented INSPIRE uses cases. This last section deals with HLANDATA requirements' collection and offers more detailed results about real users' preferences.

==== Features

Most of the use cases require a complete coverage of the area of interest with information regarding the use of land. The concept of dominant land use for each piece of land is acceptable although it may be often required to have information on other possible land uses. It is often required to identify the land use components over a user-defined area which has no connection to the limits of homogeneous land use area.

The intensity of use is also very important for many use cases in order to evaluate the human pressure on the environment (i.e. residential human density, intensity of crops production, etc.).

About scopes covered by data demanded by users, there is a preference for natural areas potentially regulated by environmental plans or risk zones, such as wetlands, waters or river shores.

_Land Use_ and Land cover are nonetheless concepts on which the use cases have difficulties to differentiate. It comes from the actual databases where both concepts are mixed. INSPIRE Land Cover and _Land Use_ data specification must reflect the independence between land use and land cover, but must not impose new data production.

Level of detail or minimum mapping unit (mmu) in existing land use data sets plays a crucial element for the data usability. Users choose or reject information based on it. After analysis it have been extracted that this factor also is related with the typology of user. Organizations with National territory competence requires data at around 1:25.000 scale (mmu 2ha), meanwhile Regional or Local institutions prefer more accurate data at around 1:5.000 scale (mmu 0.5ha).

For modelling purposes the complete land use coverage in a single layer is required (i.e. no overlaps, no gaps, no missing or duplicate polygons).

There is a requirement to relate land use elements to other geographical objects that are visible in the reality but it is seldom required to implement geometric relationships with these objects.

==== Nomenclature

No commonly agreed nomenclature has been identified during the use case analysis. Nonetheless there is a practical agreement to use a multi-level hierarchical nomenclature separating the land use from land cover. There is a requirement to refer to different types of economic activities (referring to NACE or national correlated equivalent codes).

Alternative modelling taking account more than one presence of land use category per piece of land (object oriented philosophy) is considered complex as a unique harmonization methodology.

==== Temporal dimension

Temporal information is often quoted as an important issue to be dealt with. Comparing the existing land use through time is important and raises the issue of solving inconsistencies between the respective geometries of LU data sets over the same area but at different dates (how to deal with slivers?). It has been thought that the issue needs to be solved either at the producer level (e.g. in providing existing land use datasets based on a stable geometric delineation of polygons) or at the user level in his information system (e.g. in considering the respective positional accuracy of the datasets.

A dataset providing only changes in land use between two dates has not been required by the analyzed use cases.

After a review of required update frequency, most of the users asked for a high updating frequency for land use databases because currently there are many land inventories that undertake yearly updates.

==== Quality control

It has been recognised that the issue needs to be solved either at the producer level (e.g. in providing existing land use datasets based on a stable geometric delineation of polygons) or at the user level in his information system (e.g. in considering the respective positional accuracy of the datasets

==== Identifiers

Identifiers would be helpful, for example they should enable to identify which objects from detailed _Land Use_ datasets are aggregated to/are part of or are represented by which object(s) in less detailed _Land Use_ dataset like CORINE Land Cover.

==== Portrayal

A consistent portrayal for Existing _Land Use_ is often quoted as useful in case of visualisation of adjacent datasets provided by different producers, preferably based on a harmonized land use nomenclature for the entire Europe..

==== Metadata

Normal metadata are required such as who produced the data set, when and for what purpose, date of recording (remote sensing data) respectively date of data collection (surveying and mapping), etc. Metadata at feature level might be useful but it has been thought difficult to implement it in the proposed data specification.

In terms of degree of dependence it's important to know the actuality of features (date of last update or date representing the reality).

==== Consistency with other themes

The consistency with other INSPIRE themes such as land cover, Utility and Government Services, Production and Industrial Facilities, Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities, Transport, Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units is important. But it seems that the models should not implement relationships between existing land use polygons and the geographical objects of other themes as the link can be computed using the geometry. Also the same geometry from National databases can serve to several INSPIRE data themes, for example a polygon in a National LC/LU database could be used for both INSPIRE themes.

==== Detailed user's assessment from HLANDATA project 

The first step of the HLANDATA project dealt with the assessment of the current European situation regarding the harmonization of the Land Cover and _Land Use_ data. An assessment of the end users and their needs from the point of view of data harmonization was carried out footnote:[Deliverables of Work Package 1 (Diagnostic of users and databases) at http://www.hlandata.eu/]. In detail users' assessment report includes the catalogue of user requirements, involving information recompilation about: general and basic information about the user (i.e competence area, thematic ambit, legal frame, typology, etc.); current used databases and aspects related with acquisition, utilization, satisfaction or dissemination of data; current used webservices, distinguishing between type and frequency of service; and a detailed list of needed data.

Al project partners where requested to be involved in the collection through their particular knowledge of users and used databases in their countries. To obtain these information, a set of questionnaires were elaborated in order to gather all the information needed to carry out the LC/LU users assessments. Each questionnaire were filled by each partner as they were the only ones aware of the inside of the project. Due to the characteristics and level of detail of the forms, they had to be completed in close communication with involved users, via meeting or via telephone. All partners collaborated with questionnaires, so a global European overview was reached from national study evaluations, following bottom-up dimensioning.

As a summary of Requirements Inventory some key comments are given in the following. Analysed organizations can demand more than one requirement; especially there are organizations with 5-8 items and others with only 1 or 2, to reach a total of 216 needs. A better way to understand each concrete interest is to review numeric reports over filled questionnaires, and an overview on themes, frequency of update, scales or minimum mapping unit can be done to extract general considerations.

In a general view, Environmental lands predominate, 23 Wetlands (10,65%) and 23 Forests (10,65%); together with 20 Settlements (9,26%). The frequency for update required for users of 1 year (107, i.e. 49,54%). Concerning geometric aspects, the demanded scale is 1:25.000 for 113 cases (52,31%) and the minimum polygon size is 1 ha (89 i.e. 41,2%), vector information is the most commonly used (118 i.e. 54,63%) and shapefile the preferred format (106 i.e. 49,07%). Regarding land categories needed for the users in the catalogue the main groups of land type, which are mostly required, are given in the following table:

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
|Land Theme |Users requiring |Update frequency (years) |Scale |MMU
|Forest / Unique trees / Vegetation / Riverbank formation / others |13 / 1 / 1 / 2 ; and more |1 to 5, but mostly 1 |1.25.000 (mostly) to 1:5.000 |0,1 to 2,5 ha

Table of required land information by users


=== Planned land use data requirements
==== Features

The use case imply to have access to the zoning elements and the areas where supplementary regulation that are present in spatial plans, as well as a graphic map that indicates on which area the plan is applied and the textual planning requirements. Geometric delimitation of zoning elements and supplementary regulation is given by spatial plan requirements, not by mapping rules.

When converted into a vector format, the requirements include the following layers:

* A geometrically accurate polygon layer with polygons that are collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive (over the area that is mapped), provides the information on zoning. Each polygon has an attribute which refers to the text of the zoning regulation. A direct link to the pdf-file may be available.
* A geometrically accurate polygon layer, with possible overlapping geometry provides information on restrictions that affect land areas. Each polygon has an attribute which refers to the text of the constraint regulation. A direct link to the pdf-file may be required
* A geometrically *not* accurate polygon layer provides complementary information on projected areas
* A geometrically accurate line layer provides information on existing line infrastructure such as roads, railways
* A geometrically *not* accurate line layer provides information on projected line infrastructure with its exact position being not yet known
* A geometrically accurate point layer
* A geometrically *not* accurate point layer
* A polygon layer with the contour of the whole plan
* A polygon layer with the contour of parts of the plan

In most of the European countries old plans are not always converted into polygon features. These plans are however (or most of them) required as a geo-referenced raster image.

Information on the step reached by the spatial planning process is often required, e.g. when a new plan has been ratified by the appropriate authority, when a plan has replaced another or when updates due to other reasons need to take place, or if a new plan is under preparation, scrutiny or approval.

==== Nomenclature

Some European countries have their national nomenclature for Planned _Land Use_, but for many of them, the nomenclature is standardised at the regional or municipal level. Examples of nomenclatures are provided in annex C.

==== Temporal dimension

Temporal information is often required. Land predestinations and post destinations can be allocated to land portion, that is why overlapping polygons are required

==== Identifiers

A general unique code for each article of the textual regulation is requested, enabling to assign with no ambiguity which regulation apply on which polygon of the zoning. Identifiers for each polygon are not necessary.

==== Quality control

Stable geometric delimitation should be guaranteed in the spatial plan definition by competent planer administration.

==== Portrayal

A non geo-referenced legend file (tiff or pdf) must be exchanged for each plan, which enumerates all the used symbols on the plan and their title. For getting more detailed information on the meaning of the symbol set the textual part itself has to be consulted.

==== Metadata

Each individual plan must have a metadata fiche. This gives information about the contents, origins, projection system and quality.

==== Consistency with other themes

In case expropriation of owners of certain parcels, the exact parcel number and address is required.

Other rules and regulations that apply to that zone need to be considered with the zoning plan (Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units).

A natural disaster is therefore the consequence of the combination of a natural hazard and human activities. Main natural hazards are: avalanches, drought, earthquakes, floods, land slides, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornado, cyclones, wildfires, etc. 
 
NOTE 2: Technological risk / Technological hazard A technological risk is necessarily related to human activities in the fields of manufacturing and energy production, transport, buildings, public works, etc. Risks due to industrial, nuclear, mining and subterranean activities or risks due to the transport of hazardous substances (by land, river or sea) or the threat of a dam rupture are all considered major technological risks.

The central place system constitutes a hierarchy of basic, lower-order or small centres, middle-order centres, and high-order centres as determined at the different levels of state spatial planning. Some states insert intermediate categories in the hierarchy. Depending on their assignment to a central place, catchment areas are defined as local, intermediate or extended areas.

[appendix]
== Towards the Hierarchical INSPIRE _Land Use_ nomenclature - (informative) 

In order to determine the nomenclature that should be used in the data specifications of the INSPIRE theme land use several existing nomenclatures have been reviewed to evaluate if it is possible to adopt one of these existing nomenclatures or whether it is necessary to make a new one. The difficulty in composing a nomenclature for land use is the fact that the INSPIRE theme deals with two different views on land use; one deals with the existing land use including from a statistical point of view, while the other deals with the future land use from a planners point of view. This means that besides deciding which nomenclature should be used; there is also a decision about whether or not the same nomenclature for both types of land use should be adopted.

The list of nomenclatures below is not meant to be exhaustive. The choice of investigated nomenclatures is solely based on the fact that these nomenclatures were known by the members of the TWG or provided as reference material. For each classification system the main categories are mentioned to enable comparison.

=== Investigated classification systems

_A.1.1 ISIC Rev.3 (International Standard Classification of All Economic Activities)_

The ISIC classification was drawn up by the United Nations (approved by the Statistical Commission in 1989) and recommended for use throughout the world. The ISIC is intended to be a standard classification of productive economic activities. This classification is integrated in the sense that it ensures a full harmonization with another main branch of economic classifications: the classifications of products (ICPC Central Product Classification) which are fundamental for foreign trade statistics, statistics of production and consumption, energy statistics, etc. The ISIC classification may therefore be appropriate to characterise land use percentages for administrative units. The ISIC Rev. 3, is fully compatible with the EU NACE Rev. 1 (Nomenclature des Activités de la Communauté Européenne) system for the first two levels. (System replaced by 1.1.2008, see references). The ISIC Rev.3 uses 4 levels of classification: 17 sections, which are further divided into 62 divisions. The third level consists of groups, while the fourth level is further divided into classes.

The ISIC system is however not in use within the spatial planners community mainly because it does not provide entries for "residential area", "recreation areas", "mix residential-activity area" that are common in spatial planning documents.

==== LUCAS (_Land Use_ / Cover Area Frame Survey)

The LUCAS nomenclature used to be applied for surveys focused on agriculture. Since 2008 the scope has been enlarged to land cover/use in general. The main aim of the LUCAS survey is to gather harmonised information on land use/cover and their changes over time. In addition the survey provides territorial information facilitating the analysis of the interactions between agriculture, environment and countryside. The LUCAS nomenclature has separate classification systems for land cover and land use. Land cover is defined as the physical cover of the earth's surface and land use is the socio-economic function of the land.. _Land Use_ has 15 main categories. It has altogether 34 classes, which are indicated by the combination of the letter "U" and three digits. The same nomenclature is applied in all EU countries in the LUCAS survey. It also allows comparisons in time (since LUCAS 2006 survey). It is as much as possible compatible with the existing land cover/use systems (e.g. FAO, NACE and Farm Structure Survey).

The LUCAS classification is used for statistical purposes and is therefore more difficult to adopt for planned land use. The biggest problem seems to be the lack of mixed land uses.

==== Urban Atlas

The Urban Atlas is providing pan-European comparable land use and land cover data for Large Urban Zones with more than 100.000 inhabitants as defined by the Urban Audit. The GIS data can be downloaded together with a map for each urban area covered and a report with the metadata.

Earth observation data are the basis for interpretation. Topographic maps in digital form with precise geo-coding are used for interpretation of objects. Application of automatic classification routines, as segmentation and clustering are applied whenever appropriate: Automated segmentation and classification to achieve a first differentiation into basic land cover/land use classes (urban vs. forest vs. water vs. other land cover/land use).

The Urban Atlas nomenclature mixes land use classes with land cover classes. It has a hierarchical nature.

==== Plan4All

Plan4all is a European project co-funded by the Community programme _eContentplus_. The main aim of the project is to harmonise spatial planning data and related metadata according to the INSPIRE principles. The aim of work package 4 is to define data models for several INSPIRE themes including land use. First of all they have compared several different models from different countries. The second step was to make an overall data model including classifications. The data model for land use uses four different classifications: 'LUCAS', 'MacroClassificationOfLand, 'GeneralLandUseType and 'SpecificLandUseType'. 'LUCAS' uses the LUCAS classification, and the 'specific land use type' uses the classification used in each country/region. This classification should (if used) be uploaded into the model.

The Plan4all model is based on land use form a planner's point of view, so it is less useful for the existing land use. Besides this it is also a complicated model with a lot of detailing.

==== FR-CNIG – Plan local d'urbanisme – Plan d'occupation des sols

The standard aims at defining a standard way of converting spatial planning documents at the parcel level into a digital form. It defines a nomenclature of planned land use that is applicable by all local governments. A fist version was finalised in 2006 and updated in 2010. The approach is significantly different to the approaches such as LBCS, NLUD or LUCAS as it provides a nomenclature for planned land use.

Two levels are defined:

* a "simplified zone type" with only 5 main classes (built-up area, to be built-up area (divided into two sub-classes), agriculture area, natural area, natural area that can be built-up (divided into two sub-classes)
* the dominant vocation of the area divided into 11 classes (not applicable, residential, activity, residential/activity mix, leisure and tourism, amenities, agriculture activity, natural space, remarkable space, quarrying, other)

The standard also provides a nomenclature for prescriptions that are superimposed on land-use area providing supplementary regulations on the possibility to change land-use. 25 categories are provided (e.g. classified woodland, sector with provision of reconstruction / demolition, specific limitation for building implementation, placeholder, area with development guidelines, etc.)

==== NL-BBG – Bestand Bodemgebruik

Since the 1940's the statistics department of The Netherlands is periodically compiling an overview of the land use in The Netherlands. The geometry is based on the topographical map. The functional classification is made up out of two levels.

The classification seems to be quite generic, grouping residential areas, service oriented areas and industry into one category of built-up area. BBG also gives great attention to the main class of water.

==== UK-National _Land Use_ Database: _Land Use_ and Land Cover Classification

The NLUD classification is intended to provide in the United Kingdom a framework for harmonising existing classifications, to facilitate consistent collection and reporting of land use and land cover information, and to provide the basis for the creation of national data sets. It has been designed to serve as a standard classification available for adoption by bodies involved in the routine collection of land use and land cover data. NLUD definition of _Land Use_: "land use relates to the activity or socio-economic function for which land is used". An interesting aspect that is mentioned is 'mixing' or 'different combination of classes', which is divided into three different types: two dimensional (juxtaposition), three dimensional (superposition) and temporal. That implies a more complicated data model, may be using an object oriented data model, to assign different classes to polygons or parcels. This nomenclature uses a two-tier approach with the possibility to add third level tiers at local level.

This approach is similar to the LUCAS classification. It is also mainly used for statistical purposes and is therefore more difficult to adopt for planned land use. The biggest problem seems to be the lack of mixed land uses.

==== US-LBCS (Land-Based Classification Standards)

In 1994, the American Planning Association (APA) reported on the findings of a survey of federal, state, regional, and local needs for an updated land-use classification standard in USA. Then, in May 1996, APA, along with the participation of six other federal agencies, initiated the Land-Based Classification Standards (LBCS) project. Through this project, APA and its partners produced a new land classification system to allow jurisdictions, agencies, and institutions at the local, regional, state, and national level to share land-based data. The first version of LBCS was released in 2000, and the standards have been updated periodically in the intervening years. The model extends the notion of classifying land uses by refining traditional categories into multiple dimensions. The 5 dimensions are: activity, function, structure, site and ownership. Each dimension has its own set of categories and subcategories, giving in total the possibility to use up to 4 levels of detail. These multiple dimensions allow users to have precise control over land use classifications

LBCS is an interesting model for land use classification. Because of the different dimensions a very detailed and accurate picture of the actual land use can be made. This provides the advantage of flexibility (one of the recommendations in D2.6) for the Member States to adapt to the data specifications. They will then have the choice which (combination) of dimensions they want to use or are compliant to their own data model. The dimension 'function' would be the most important (and maybe also most easy) to use because it is more similar to nomenclatures used by land use planners and also similar to the nomenclatures of LUCAS. It could therefore be an option to make this dimension mandatory and the other ones optional. On the other side of the coin, INSPIRE implementation rules should be careful in providing models that are too detailed or to complex to implement for the member states. As no new data will be collected by the Member States to be compliant with the data specifications, it is assumed that existing data will be transformed to the general model. LBCS model is a bit confusing and not simple in use.

Overall there is too much detail and the whole system is too complex.

=== Conclusions

For the INSPIRE _Land Use_ theme it is desirable to work with one nomenclature for both the existing and the planned land use. For this reason it has been chosen to start from the LUCAS nomenclature, since this is the most widely spread used nomenclature and other classifications can be matched to the LUCAS classes. The Plan4All workgroup has also advised in its data model the use of LUCAS as one of the classifications. As stated above however there remains the difficulty of mixed zones for planned land use. This problem could be avoided if new classes would be added to the LUCAS nomenclature for the use in the INSPIRE land use theme. The TWG advises to adopt a hierarchical land use classification system for INSPIRE. It is further developed from the LUCAS classification and clearly more hierarchical.

The advantage of using the same nomenclature for both the existing and planned land use would be that it is possible to make comparisons between different years and between present and future. This comparison between existing and planned land use is not to be confused with temporal dimension: planned is the expected or foreseen land use (to be built), while existing is the real land use (past or present). The planned land use may not always become the existing land use, plans may not be executed or illegal activities may occur. The temporal dimension is used in the existing land use as time stamps for each data set. It will have versioning, change control and evolutions, used for study of temporal attributes with a unique identifier for polygons. An example of this is the CORINE 90-00-06 land cover.

For Land Cover, a density of buildings/trees is a physical characteristic, For _Land Use_ density refers to the intensity of activities (agriculture, farming, manufacturing, services...)

As a general guide, the identification and recording of land use should be at the smallest spatial unit that resources will permit. This provides the greatest flexibility and ability to aggregate to larger spatial units if required by other applications. Therefore the "minimum unit of interest" shall be documented.

=== HILUCS Frequently asked questions:

This list of questions and answers helps the HILUCS user to identify the proper class for rare, specific or borderline land use cases:

[cols=",",]
|===
|Q1: Under which class cemeteries belong? |A1: Cemeteries are part of class 3.3.5 'Other community services'
|Q2: How can protected areas be classified? |A2: They are classified according to the land use (e.g. if forestry is allowed under 1.2). If no use is allowed they are classified under 6.3.1 'Land areas not in other use'. A supplementary regulation 'protected' is always needed.
|Q3: Under which class irrigation ponds belong? |A3: They belong to class 1.1.1 'Commercial agricultural protection'.
|Q4: How to classify industrial storage areas? |A4: They are part of the main industry branch, if adjacent to the industrial plant. Only pure storage and logistical services are classified under 4.2.
|Q5: How to classify summer and other secondary residences? |A5: If they are privately owned they fall into 5.3 'Other residential use' if they are rented and linked to services they fall under class 3.1.3 'Accommodation services'.
|Q6: where to map filling stations to |A6: filling station for vehicles will have two codes 3.1.1 because filling stations are wholesale and retail trade for fuel and 4.1.1. because they are road transport facilities (service station)
|Q7: How to classify pedestrian zones, home zones or bikeways? |A7: They belong to class 4.1.5 'Other transport network'
|Q8: How to classify areas for dumping of earth? |A8: They belong to class 6 'Other uses'
|Q9: How to classify areas for mitigation and replacement measures as compensation for disturbance of a landscape area to restore or recreate the structural and functional character of the natural habitat and the necessary ecological balance? |A9: They belong to class 6.3 'Natural areas not in other economic use'
|Q10:How to classify areas where occurs other primary productions which are not professional hunting, gathering of wild growing non-wood forestry products, or husbandry of migratory animals? |A10: They belong to class 1_5_OtherPrimaryProduction

== Hierarchical Supplementary Regulation Code List - (informative) 

=== Introduction

During the consultation process, comments have been provided related to the possible values for the attribute supplementaryRegulation. In the testing material, CZ, FR and DE provided files showing the matching between national code list and the list provided in the LU data specification version 2.0. The analysis of the testing report also provides other input and the code list associated with the attribute zoneTypeCode of the feature ManagementRestrictionOrRegulationZone in the AM data specification influences the list philosophy.

The next section provides the first draft of the future INSPIRE Hierarchical supplementary Regulation code list provided in this LU data specification.

Three entries from the AM data specification have been set aside (riverBasinDistrict[multiblock footnote omitted], marineRegion[multiblock footnote omitted] and animalHealthRestrictionZone[multiblock footnote omitted]) as not being perceived as a supplementary regulation.

Two main categories of supplementary regulation can be defined from the current list:

* Supplementary regulation that is imported in the spatial plan from regulations that externally condition the spatial plan often due to legislations other than spatial planning laws (1_ImpactOnEnvironement, 2_RiskExposure, 3_HeritageProtection, 4_GeneralInterest
* Supplementary regulation that is defined within the spatial plan by the competent authority responsible for the spatial plan (5_LandPropertyRight, 6_RegulationsOnBuildings, 7_LocalRegionalStateDevelopmentPolicies, 8_SocialHealthChoices, 9_RegulatedActivities)

A last category 10_OtherSupplementaryRegulation is provided in order to enable room for supplementary regulation types that has not been foreseen.

Supplementary regulation that is inherited from spatial plan that have legal precedence (e.g. area of a zoning plan where restrictions are imposed by a structure plan) (previously 10_PlansWithLegalPrecedence in LU-DS 2.0) is now seen as a qualifier for any supplementary regulation. In the PLU data model a boolean attribute of the feature type "SupplementaryRegulation" called "inheritedFromPlanWithLegalPrecedence" implements the qualifier.

=== Proposed Hierarchical Supplementary Regulation Code List (HSRCL)

The code list is provided in Annex C.

=== Examples of mapping HSRCL with national coding systems

This section is a contribution of the experts of the TWG-LU. IT is their vision of how national code lists could be mapped with HSRCL. Note that the national terminology is kept in the national language as well as the definition of terms where applicable.

== _Land Use_ and Land Cover Relations - (informative) 

Land Cover and _Land Use_ have been considered for decades as remarkable aspects for describing and understanding land's physiognomy and utilization. Land Cover and _Land Use_ information is important background information for environmental issues related to the land surface such as habitats, biodiversity, catchments hydrology, and climate change[multiblock footnote omitted]

The three main and essential features in the context of describing the interrelation between Land Cover and _Land Use_ are: (1) the concepts of Land Cover and _Land Use_, (2) the questions of land units, and (3) the available sources of data for feeding such a component. The third feature will not be commented in the following paragraphs.

=== Land cover and land use definitions

Definition for Land Cover and _Land Use_ concepts is widely known in many of land nomenclatures and projects, and INSPIRE 2007/2/CE Directive mainly defines them as bio-physical and functional range on land, respectively.

* Land Cover: Physical and biological cover of the earth's surface including artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forests, (semi-)natural areas, wetlands, water bodies.
* _Land Use_: Territory characterised according to its current and future planned functional dimension or socio-economic purpose.

There are also more definitions available from UN FAO, UE CORINE and LUCAS projects or national databases that complement and clarify in detail their definitions. In particular it is remarkable that both definitions are feasible for different scopes: 1) on, above or below of surface, and 2) terrestrial, marine and aerial areas.

The relation between Land Cover and _Land Use_ is strong and indissoluble, because the existence of use implies causes and consequences on cover and vice versa. Land Cover and _Land Use_ are essential components of the land as for each location one type of Land Cover and one type of _Land Use_ can be identified. However, definitions of Land cover and _Land Use_ in many existing information systems and nomenclatures are often mixed, they are even sometimes seen as the same phenomenon. Notwithstanding to reach a complete solution of both components, initially Land Cover and _Land Use_ should be treated in parallel way for finally inferring the joint vision. They describe quite distinct dimensions of the land surface and should be separately defined and classified to prevent ambiguous interpretations.

Furthermore it is important to remind that, contrarily to Land Cover, many __Land Use__s cannot be directly extracted using land monitoring techniques such as aerial photography, and require direct field observation or the use of ancillary (planning) data.

There are various approaches that describe the concept of _Land Use_ in different ways. In the literature the following aspects are often quoted

* "Functional" corresponds to the description of land in terms of its socio-economic purpose (agricultural, residential, forestry etc.) and links with Land Cover are possible. It could be simply identified as "activities"
* "Sequential" corresponds to a series of operations on land, carried out by humans, with the intention to obtain products and/or benefits through using land resources. It could be simply identified as "results form activities".

In the _Land Use_ data specification three main aspects have been modelled as feature types:

* "Existing" or material _Land Use_ in the time of observation. Traditionally, activities effectively carried out are taken into consideration. These activities are collected from land observation and monitoring projects.
* "Planned" _Land Use_ regulated by spatial planning documents elaborated at various levels of administration.
* "Supplementary regulations" are information and/or limitations on _Land Use_ activities according to regulations. It restricts or conditions the exercise of the freedom to use one's land property

The choice has been made to incorporate the "Functional" and "Sequential" aspects into the _Land Use_ nomenclatures.

=== Dependencies and consequences between land cover and land use

Due to the close relation between Land Cover and _Land Use_ the presence of a particular Land Cover often conditions the _Land Use_ type and can prevent other land uses. Also the other way round is possible, the present Land Cover can be deduced or the future Land Cover can be predicted from a specific _Land Use_ type. In this way, rules of inference could be established for different applications to identify trends or changes.

For example, a parcel of land covered by field crops can reasonably be associated with agricultural use, or a river area will only be used for transport and fishing. A residential area will be made up of a mosaic of land cover types including dwellings, other buildings, gardens, roads, paths, woodland and bare surfaces. Similarly, an area used for managed forestry would be expected to be covered by trees. If it were not, then it may be inferred that the woodland had been felled or the land was being prepared for forestation. Or a parcel designated in a plan to be urban park will contain vegetation coverage in the future instead artificial structures.

Another important aspect regarding Land Cover and _Land Use_ is the thematic level of detail of each no-menclature. For reaching favourable results relating Land Cover and _Land Use_ data, there have to be comparable classes with a similar level of thematic detail in each nomenclature.

=== Land unit

'Land' is a widely-used and often loosely-defined term, but classifications are closely tied to the uses which will be made of land data collected. Land Unit can be defined as __"A delineable area of the earth's terrestrial surface, embracing all attributes of the biosphere immediately above or below this surface, including those of the near surface climate, the soil and terrain forms, the surface hydrology including shallow lakes, rivers, marshes and swamps, the near-surface sedimentary layers and associated groundwater and geohydrological reserves, the plant and animal populations, the human settlement pattern and physical results of past and present human activity (terracing, water storage or drainage structures, roads, buildings, etc.)"__footnote:[IDWG-LUP at UN-FAO, 1994]

However the delineation of Land Cover and _Land Use_ types is often difficult as there are no easily identifiable natural 'units' or 'objects' that form the basis for identification of Land Cover and _Land Use_ types. Where an object has a physical boundary (e.g. factory, dwelling, plot of grazing land) due to its man-made origin, it is easily identifiable. However, identifying objects and delineating boundaries in semi-natural environments or complex buildings is more intractable. Even more complicated is the delineation of objects with multiple uses to be identified vertically, i.e. use above and below ground level at the same location.

A spatial information system regarding Land Cover or _Land Use_ needs spatial units that are represented by geometry like a polygon or a grid cell. For defining a Land Unit, two fundamental principles are important:

* Land Units should represent homogeneous and continuous Land Cover or _Land Use_.
* Land Units should be conformed to cartographic restrictions as Minimum Mapping Unit, and/or shape of land unit (e.g. minimum width).

When the complexity of the real world is simple both principles can be maintained to delineate the Land Cover or _Land Use_. However, when the reality is more complex the correct identification can't meet both principles. Normally, for simplifying the management of information, the second principle takes preference over the first, resulting in mixtures of land use types in horizontal, vertical or temporal dimension.

Horizontal mixing by 'juxtaposition' is strongly dependant on the scale and unit of observation e.g. the mixing of sports facilities with other recreational areas within an outdoor amenity space or the assemblage of uses within a defined industrial site. These configurations are usually handled through definition and application of rules. Rules of 'preferences' usually are employed for _Land Use_,. An example is the 'main activity' rule which determines the activity on which other activities or uses depend and without which they would loose their purpose. This is illustrated by a manufacturing plant that accommodates several uses additional to, but dependent on, manufacturing, such as storage, car and lorry parking and offices.

[.text-center]
*_Horizontal mixing 'juxtaposition'_*

Vertical mixing in the third dimension is caused by 'superposition' of different covers or uses. Mixing in the third dimension is independent of scale of observation and requires a rule so that elements are correctly identified and recorded. Blocks of offices and/or flats with shops at ground level provide a classic case of mixing by superposition. 'Mapping' rules such as 'majority use' or 'ground floor use' are sometimes used in land use surveys to cartographically depict _Land Use_. However, in both cases there is a loss of information which could be significant for user related purposes. Recording all uses at all levels provides a more generic approach that can serve multiple applications and still allows, if necessary, the subsequent application of a mapping rule to simplify the occurrence of multiple uses for display purposes.

image::./media/image61.png[image,width=285,height=208, align=center]

[.text-center]
*_Vertical mixing 'superposition'_*

Temporal mixing is used to describe instances where the land accommodates more than one cover or use and is highly dependent on the time of observation. Temporal mixing can be virtually simultaneous, for example, forestry and recreation, water storage and recreation, or can occur over longer cycles, for example, weekday car park and weekend market. Again the application of a 'mapping' rule such as 'primary use' that seeks to identify a single or primary use for each piece of land will result in a loss of information. Recording all instances of use is usually preferred.

[.text-center]
*_Temporal mixing_*

With the previous definition of the Land Unit it is clear that different geometries for LU and LC exist. The relation between these geometries depends on the complexity of the land information system. The simplest relationship between the LC and LU is the superposition of both geometries that will not fit 1:1 in most cases.

[appendix]
== Proposed changes to D2.3 V3.0 - (informative) 

There are two main land use definitions, a *functional* one and *sequential* one (Duhamel, 1998). The functional definition defines land use as _the description of land in terms or its socio-economic purpose (agricultural, residential, forestry etc.)_. The sequential definition describes land use as _a series of operations on land, carried out by humans, with the intention to obtain products and/or benefits through using land resources. However, examples given for the sequential definition of land use are limited to operation sequences decided by farmers over years: ploughing, seeding, weeding, fertilizing, weeding, harvesting for maize the first year, etc. This concept would need more clarification in non agricultural domain. This sequential approach is rather complex since the majority of attributes are not inherent features of land use, the proposed system is tailored uniquely towards agricultural uses and introduces a difficult component of time (reference period of observation and cycles). Providing such detailed information would raise many questions: who needs this information, how to design a cost-efficient system at such a detailed level? In addition, links with land cover classification could not be ensured._

_Therefore the functional definition of Land Use will be used for defining the relevant INSPIRE theme. One of the key component of INSPIRE Land Use theme will be the nomenclature that defines the socio-economic purpose taken into consideration and the level of detail to be retained as well as the question of extensive use versus intensive use of land, e.g. regarding agriculture practices, level of social mix, or density of houses._

=== _Land Use_ plans/land use regulation

The land use plans regulate actual and future use of areas. The land use plans commonly have significant textual regulations to each area/land category or specific areas. The land use plans are of varying detail; Municipal land use plans, detailed regulation plans for blocks or smaller areas within urban areas.

* _Land Use_ may be seen as divisions at a nationwide level, e.g. distinguishing between private and state owned land.
* _Land Use_ plan is commonly made at regional levels as kinds of master plans, e.g. covering the full extent of several municipalities, the borders of areas defined in the map being fuzzy
* Land regulation plans at detailed low level may cover populated areas or areas of specific economic or social interest. The plans may direct utilization level, the % of building coverage within areas, height regulations or functional regulations, and maps produced apply to the cadastral,parcels.

It is a very diverse situation concerning land regulation/land use plans as these spatial data commonly are based on national or regional legislation or other kinds of regulation. The documents/maps are frequently seen as legal documents, and the categories remain for decades as rights directing use land and property. These documents are opposable to third parties in their paper form and their digital versions have no legal status in many European countries. Does INSPIRE have to deal with the textual regulation, necessarily written in the national languages? Focussing on the broader categories, but the option is left open for countries to add a hyperlink to the full land use regulation text. Categories of land use follow such regulations. Furthermore, operational plans may for some areas be old and based on older legislation, and their nomenclature may be obsolete. Operational land use plans may be as old as 100 years or more. Also plans being proposed and being in a process or public/sectoral hearing can be relevant for dissemination in the infrastructure. The time dimension is also related to the process of devising a spatial planning document as well as the relation between past land use zoning and the actual changes in the land use observed long time after plan is approved.

It is possible to allocate three different land uses to one parcel: the pre-destination, the destination and the after-destination. For example an agricultural area is allowed to keep on existing until 2012, after which it will be turned into a mining area, after the mining has finished the land will be converted into a nature reserve.

=== Functional land use – according to socio-economic purpose

Functional areas within urban or rural areas may be mapped through fieldwork, register information or through modelling using socio-economic input data in a GIS. A classification of the land use phenomenon may be based on the ISIC Rev.3 (International Standard Classification of All Economic Activities) classification drawn up by the United Nations (approved by the Statistical Commission in 1989) and recommended for use throughout the world. This classification is integrated in the sense that it ensures a full harmonization with another main branch of economic classifications: the classifications of products (ICPC Central Product Classification) which are fundamental for foreign trade statistics, statistics of production and consumption, energy statistics, etc. The ISIC classification may therefore be appropriate to characterise land use percentages for administrative units. The ISIC Rev. 3, is fully compatible with the EU NACE Rev. 1 (Nomenclature des Activités de la Communauté Européenne) system for the first two levels. (System replaced by 1.1.2008, see references). On the other hand the ISIC system is not in use within the spatial planers community mainly because is does not provide entries for "residential area", "recreation areas", "mix residential-activity area" that are common in spatial planning documents.

Whichever system will be recommended in the INSPIRE Context, member states will have to develop their own mapping from national classification to it. The question remains with the planners' usage regarding land use classes. Being contacted, the International Society of City and Regional Planners (ISOCARP) has not developed any such classification scheme.

=== Scope, use examples

Many of the management and planning activities at local level require detailed data. Proper location, the geographical position, is important. The level of accuracy needed in location varies, the need for (and will to produce) accurate data being higher in urban or built-up areas and lower in rural and natural/semi-natural environments. Data producers may be requested to provide information on the positional accuracy and the exhaustivity of their LU datasets. The concept of "minimum LU unit" questions the mandatory provision of the size of the MLU unit by the producer. Similarly, interest in frequent updating decreases with distance from central areas. The detailed area planning covers both land and sea/coastal areas including inland and some off shore water bodies.

_Land Use_ is important for impact assessment and monitoring of implementation of policies and legal instruments for sustainable management of the environment, like Natura2000.

*Policies:*

6EAP, EIA guidelines. Several policies and strategies give highlight the value of regional approaches with integrated land/area management, such as the Integrated Coastal Zone Management, Communication on planning and environment, Water Framework Directive and the Communication on risk prevention.

Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for projects and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEAs) for policies, plans and programmes ensure that significant environmental impacts are identified, assessed and taken into account in decision-making process to which the public can participate.

Others European policies and issues including the climate change policy, sea level rise, Urban sprawl, soil directive, polluted soil, regional policies and related relevant national policies will require _Land Use_ information.

=== Important feature types and attributes

Kinds of features depend on kind of land use and land use plan. A representation of a land use plan may be structured as a layered dataset.

* boundary of plan/regulation
* land use category area
* land use regulation area or prescription regarding land use
* land use restriction area or constraints regarding land use (in connection with the Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units theme)
* elements within a plan (road boundaries, building boundaries, forest/agricultural land boundaries etc.)

Does the "back-ground" or reference material over which the zoning map is created be part of the _Land Use_ theme? Is it an information to be documented in the Metadata associated with LU datasets? This raise the issue of relative positional accuracy of two layers to be superimposed.

Important attributes

* land use category
* land use regulation category
* land use restriction category
* present/existing or proposed/planned/future
* legal reference
* date of entry into force
* link to text regulations for each area

== Ecological function of land - (informative) 

According to the INSPIRE definition land use is described as a functional dimension or socio-economic purpose. This view on land use raises the question if nature / protecting biodiversity / the ecological function of land can be seen as a human activity and thus can be classified as land use. It is arguable that nature does not serve an economic function for humans. In this light, nature areas should be classified as areas with no use. There is however another view that should be taken into account, which defines land use as the description of land in terms of its socio-economic and ecological purpose.

Nature 2000 is a European agreement to create a European Ecological Network. In this agreement existing nature is protected and new nature is realized. To form this network ecological corridors and stepping stones are created in order to let species more easily spread from one area to another. The existing nature in Europe is however not something that just exists without interference of humans, this nature must be actively protected. Local, regional and national governments and associations try to enhance the biodiversity in those areas. New nature is created, for example by digging away fertile, overly fertilized top soils and revealing the poor soil underneath or by making sure the groundwater levels don't fall beneath a certain level. By doing this environments are created to attract endangered species, to give them a place where a stable community can survive.

Nature management plans are made to provide the right circumstances for target species to keep on living in a specific area. Other areas can be modified to create conditions to attract new (endangered) species. Take the example of a grassland or meadow, to make sure that rare grass-species keep on existing it is essential that the grass is often and at the right time cut. Otherwise trees will start growing that will push away the grasses and flowers. Heath or moorland is also often a created 'natural area'. If the human activity that created it stops, heath will soon become forest.

And even if nothing had to be done to make sure nature thrives in nature areas, humans still need to actively protect these areas. Without the protection or legal regulation, other (economically more interesting) functions would soon take over. Biodiversity would be at risk.

Besides the dominant land use 'nature area' these sites are often also 'used' for other human activities. They can be used as recreation area or as places to educate people. Besides direct use green environments also have a positive influence on our health, physically and mentally. Finally, all these nature areas also have an (indirect) economic value: larger numbers of plant species means a greater variety of crops (possibly useful for people in the future)

Nature areas also influence the space next to it. Green environments have a proven positive effect on humans therefore increasing the 'livability' in areas adjacent to it. Besides the positive effect on residential areas it is also interesting for the economy, having nature or green areas in the neighborhood increases the value of the property next to it. Of course it can also devaluate the property next to it when strict regulations are in place to make sure other land uses do not have a negative effect on nature. As a final remark it can be stated that greater species diversity ensures natural sustainability for all life forms and healthy ecosystems can better withstand and recover from a variety of disasters.

If you take the definition of the FAO: _Land Use_ is "the total of arrangements, activities, and inputs that people undertake in a certain land cover type", Nature or preserving nature, as argued above is definitely a form of land use.

== Use of PLU model for strategic planning in Germany - (informative) 

In Germany the essential purposes of spatial planning on regional and state level are elaborated and implemented by a range of tools on three levels:

federal spatial planning,
state spatial planning,
regional spatial planning.

On federal spatial planning level there is no binding development plan provided for controlling and developing the national territory as a whole. The Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs establish a development plan for the exclusive economic zone beyond coastal waters (200 mile zone).

State spatial planning addresses spatial development in the state as a whole, while regional planning is concerned with subdivisions of a state. State spatial planning authorities have to ensure that the goals and principles of national spatial planning and state spatial planning are respected and taken into account in local government planning. In a system of mixed top-down/bottom-up planning (principle of countervailing influence), they accept suggestions from local authorities and are required to coordinate local development goals with superordinate planning goals. The aim is to ensure that urban land-use planning does not cross the development aims of state spatial planning but supports them, thus avoiding investment mistakes. The function of these plans (name differ from state to state like state development plan or state development programme) is to coordinate the spatially relevant planning and projects of all competent organisational units and to tie them in with the conceptual aims of state spatial planning itself. In the city-states of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg a preparatory land-use plan pursuant to Section 5 of the Building Code can perform the same function.

Below state level of spatial planning, regional planning is concerned with the detailed elaboration, sectoral integration, and implementation of the goals of state spatial planning. It accordingly mediates between state spatial planning and local urban land-use planning. Regional planning must conform with federal and state spatial planning.

Municipalities are autonomous and responsible for spatial planning in their territory according to the principles and guidelines defined by higher levels.

Spatial plans on regional and state level should contain e.g. specifications concerning the spatial structure, especially with respect to:

* the desired settlement structure (HSRCL code 7.1.) which may include
** central places (HSRCL code 7.1.1.),
** development axes (HSRCL code 7.1.2.),
** assignment of functions (HSRCL code 7.1.3.),
** spatial order categories (HSRCL code 7.1.4.),
* the desired open space structure (HSRCL code 7.2.) which may include
** inter-regionally significant open spaces (HSRCL code 7.2.1. – 7.2.6.),
** uses of open space, such as sites designated to safeguard supplies of and
** systematically search for and extract location-specific raw materials (HSRCL code 7.2.7.),
* the desired infrastructure locations and routes (HSRCL code 7.3.) which may include
** traffic infrastructure and installations for transfer of goods (HSRCL code 7.3.1.)
** public utility and waste disposal infrastructure (HSRCL code 7.3.2.).

Using the state development plan of the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein as an example the following pictures exemplarily illustrate a mapping from national spatial regulations (such as desired settlement structure) to the INSPIRE HSRCL codes.
