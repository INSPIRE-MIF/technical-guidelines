== How to read the document?

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Transport Networks â€“ Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.2rc1 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _Transport Networks_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Transport Networks_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Transport Networks_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services â€“ General Executive Summary

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services,] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML â€“ Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== Transport Networks â€“ Executive Summary

*Purpose*

INSPIRE Directive (2007/2/EC, 14.03.2007) defines the spatial data theme ("theme") Transport Networks as: "Road, rail, air and water transport networks and related infrastructure. Includes links between different networks. Also includes the trans-European transport network as defined in Decision 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (footnote:[OJ L 228, 9.9.1996, p.1. Decision as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1791/2006 (OJ L 363, 20.12.2006, p.1).]) and future revisions of that Decision."

This version (3.2) of the data specification on Transport networks provides:

* the basis for the development of the part of the Implementing Rules, defined in the Article 7(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, related to the spatial data theme Transport networks and

* the implementation guidelines that will accompany the Implementing Rule on the Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services according to Article 7(1) of the INSPIRE Directive.


The data specification has been prepared by the INSPIRE Thematic Working Group Transport Networks (TWG-TN), a multinational team of experts in the field drawn from different parts of the European Union ([multiblock footnote omitted]), in the frame of the common and transparent development process.

This version of the INSPIRE data specification for Transport networks has been compiled from reference material submitted by the Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDICs) and Legally Mandated Organisation (LMOs) of INSPIRE, plus the responses to the User Requirements Survey and a set of agreed use cases - some of which have been specifically prepared by the TWG-TN based on their knowledge and experience, like environmental impact assessment, noise mapping, speed limits (related to the in-car information systems) and journey planning.

A large amount of submitted reference material was available for the road networks, largely from the mapping agencies and less input from road authorities. For the other sub-themes Rail, Water and Air transport networks the TWG-TN has had to undertake additional research, building on existing material and documentation. Research has included supporting material regarding trans-European networks and the objects required to support them, such as TEN-T, as well as other initiatives for example: specific documentation from Eurocontrol for air documentation.

*Scope and description*

The transport component should comprise of an integrated transport network, and related features, that are seamless within each national border. In accordance with Article 10(2) of the INSPIRE Directive, national transport networks may also be seamless at European level, i.e. connected at national borders. Transportation data includes topographic features that are related to transport by road, rail, water, and air. It is important that the features form networks where appropriate, and that links between different networks are established, i.e. multi-modal nodes, especially at the local level, in order to satisfy the requirements for intelligent transport systems such as location based services (LBS) and telematics. The transport network should also support the referencing of transport flows to enable the navigation services.

The data specification is extensive, covering major transport networks types that are defined in the five distinct transport themes (sub-themes): Road, Rail, Water, Air transport and Cablewaysfootnote:[Included in the data specification as a separate sub-theme based on the comments received in the consultation process.], including the connections between those types. The sub-themes are defined in a way that they can be used together to support an integrated approach to transport and they may be used with other spatial data themes. It is evident that there are a very large number of applications that can potentially use the Transport networks.

Taking into account the variety of responsibilities in collecting, managing and using the data and different approaches in the data base management practice, from simple models to complex data arrangements, this data specification is provided as basic framework and with the purpose to maximize the reuse and sharing of the data about a network. It is mainly focused on the "widely reused â€“ widely referenced" segments of spatial objects, supporting the loose linkage between the diverse organizational data with these spatial objects and allowing the extensibility to fit into div erse applications and users needs.

This approach provides a framework for users to configure and associate their own information (from surface condition surveys, to journey planning, to trans-European transport policy making etc.) using existing transport networks information in each Member State.

The datasets in scope are used extensively at the "local level" and extended to regional, national and European levels. This data specification provides a coherent approach to the forms of the representation (physical topographic area objects or centreline representations) and consistency between data sets, the latest as different types of coherence (between spatial objects of the same theme at different levels of detail, between different spatial objects within a same area or coherence at state boundaries).

All the spatial data sub-themes are based on the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model (GCM)([multiblock footnote omitted]) that relies on several ISO 19100(footnote:[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=54904]) series of geographic information standards to provide the foundations for specific aspects of interoperability.

Within the GCM, the Generic Network Model (GNM)(footnote:[Generic Network Model (GNM) is described in the Generic Conceptual Model (v3.4rc3). The GNM provides the basic structure for network nodes, links, aggregated links and areas and basic mechanisms for: grade separating crossings between network elements, cross-referencing, adding properties to a network (including the use of linear referencing) and adding inter-network connections.]) is defined to be shared by any network spatial data theme (e.g. Hydrography) to ensure a consistent approach across all network themes.

Specific mechanisms, used in the data specification and defined in the GNM, include:

* Network connection mechanism to establish the cross-border connectivity (a simple cross-referencing system to establish cross-border connections between the transport networks) or to establish intermodal connectivity (by linking two transport network elements from different transport networks which use a different mode of transport);

* Object referencing to support the reuse of information (for example to avoid the duplication of the geometry and to link complementary feature types from different organistaions);

* Linear referencing(footnote:[Linear referencing is included in the GNM based on ISO 19148.]) to support and link the different transport properties to the transport elements â€“ it is used to position phenomena along a linear object, using a distance from the beginning of the linear object and

* The mechanism to combine the network elements into high-level semantic meanings.


The elements in the network are handled as nodes, links, aggregated links, areas and points. In addition, the individual transport links can be combined to form transport link sequences or further â€“ the combination of both can be used to form the transport link sets.

The data specification includes three types of geometry: (a) (topographic) area objects, (b) centreline objects and (c) point objects. The types (a) and (b) may be alternative representations of the same real world phenomena about which the user can associate their own information (objects). The type (c) is, apart from network nodes, only included in the specification for marker posts. The basic spatial representation type is 2D vector.

Topology is handled in the data specification implicitly rather than explicitly, with the main reason to keep the model simple as possible but expecting that most applications will use the network data within a topological environment.There is therefore a prerequisite for "implicit topology", where the data provided must be sufficiently clean and capable of automated topological construction within a user's application. This concept is framed with the specific requirements, including the data quality information.

There are relationships with other spatial data themes, in particular with:

* Hydrography, where the water transport sub-theme reuses the INSPIRE river network model for inland transportation purposes and

* Addresses, where the majority of addresses can be linked to the transport links (roads, rivers, etc.).


*Next steps in the development*

It is intended that this data specification will be maintained in accordance with the future development of the INSPIRE data specification framework documents, new identified user requirements or policy requirements, development of the standards (used as a basis for data specification) and based on the best practices and on the input from the implementation of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules.

The data specification â€“ guidelines will be are published on INSPIRE web site(footnote:[http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/]).

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Transport Networks_ as defined in Annex I of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme Transport Networks.

=== Informal description

[.underline]#*Definition:*#

The _Transport Networks_ theme is defined within the INSPIRE Directive as:

_"Road, rail, air and water transport networks and related infrastructure. Includes links between different networks. Also includes the trans-European transport network as defined in Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community Guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (1) and future revisions of that Decision._

[arabic, start=1]
. _OJ L 228, 9.9.1996, p. 1. Decision as last amended by Coun    cil Regulation (EC) No 1791/2006 (OJ L 363, 20.12.2006, p. 1)"_

{empty}[Directive 2007/2/EC]

[.underline]#*Description:*#

It is further described in the INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary as follows:

_"The transport component should comprise an integrated transport network, and related features, that are seamless within each national border. In accordance with article 10.2 of the Directive, national transport networks may also be seamless at European level, i.e. connected at national borders. Transportation data includes topographic features related to transport by road, rail, water, and air. It is important that the features form networks where appropriate, and that links between different networks are established, i.e. multi-modal nodes, especially at the local level, in order to satisfy the requirements for intelligent transport systems such as location based services (LBS) and telematics. The transport network should also_ support the referencing of _transport flow to enable our navigation services."_

{empty}[INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary]

The INSPIRE Directive sets out the key requirements in the following Articles of the Directive.

[.text-center]
_"Article 4_

. _This Directive shall cover spatial data sets which fulfil the following conditions:_
[loweralpha]
.. _they relate to an area where a Member State has and/or exercises jurisdictional rights;_
.. _they are in electronic format;_
.. _they are held by or on behalf of any of the following:_
... _a public authority, having been produced or received by a public authority, or being managed or updated by that authority and falling within the scope of its public tasks;_
... _a third party to whom the network has been made available in accordance with Article 12;_
.. _they relate to one or more of the themes listed in Annex I, II or III."_

[arabic, start=2]
. _"In cases where multiple identical copies of the same spatial data set are held by or on behalf of various public authorities, this Directive shall apply only to the reference version from which the various copies are derived."_

[arabic, start=4]
. _"This Directive does not require collection of new spatial data."_

_"Article 7_

. _Implementing rules laying down technical arrangements for the interoperability and, where practicable, harmonisation of spatial data sets and services, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 22(3). Relevant user requirements, existing initiatives and international standards for the harmonisation of spatial data sets, as well as feasibility and cost-benefit considerations shall be taken into account in the development of the implementing rules."_

[arabic, start=4]
. _"Implementing rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover the definition and classification of spatial objects relevant to spatial data sets related to the themes listed in Annex I, II or III and the way in which those spatial data are geo-referenced."_

[.text-center]
_"Article 8_

. _In the case of spatial data sets corresponding to one or more of the themes listed in Annex I or II, the implementing rules provided for in Article 7(1) shall meet the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article._
. _The implementing rules shall address the following aspects of spatial data:_
[loweralpha]
.. _a common framework for the unique identification of spatial objects, to which identifiers under national systems can be mapped in order to ensure interoperability between them;_
.. _the relationship between spatial objects;_
.. _the key attributes and the corresponding multilingual thesauri commonly required for policies which may have an impact on the environment;_
.. _information on the temporal dimension of the data;_
.. _updates of the data._
[arabic, start=3]
. _The implementing rules shall be designed to ensure consistency between items of information which refer to the same location or between items of information which refer to the same object represented at different scales._
. _The implementing rules shall be designed to ensure that information derived from different spatial data sets is comparable as regards the aspects referred to in Article 7(4) and in paragraph 2 of this Article"_

To support a consistent approach to all themes the European Commission, through the Data Specifications Drafting Team, developed the "Generic Conceptual Model" [GCM] which was reviewed and published prior to the commencement of work on the Annex I themes. This is the foundation model for every theme â€“ with the intention that any theme may be combined in future and used in a way that is predicable.

The scope of the INSPIRE _Transport Networks_ Data Product Specification incorporates five distinct transport themes:

* Road transport
* Rail transport
* Water transport
* Air transport
* Cableways

This is summarised in the diagram below which shows how the Directive guides the Generic Conceptual Model [D2.5] which contains a basic framework for any kind of network model (the Generic Network Model [GNM]). From the GNM a Common Transport application schema is adapted and this then is used as the basis for all five application schema. Collectively these are drawn together in this document as the Transport Networks Data Product Specification [D2.8.1.7].

image::./media/image4.png[image,width=453,height=339, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 1 â€“ Document framework for this data product specification* {empty}[key documents only]

These themes can be used together to support an integrated approach to transport but as noted above - they may be used with other themes developed to the same standard (e.g. response to an emergency where a fuel tanker over turns on a highway and discharges into an adjacent river network). It is evident that there are a very large number of applications that can potentially use the _Transport Networks_ theme.

Understanding of the Generic Conceptual Model is essential and the GCM/GNM should be read in conjunction with this document. The GCM which describes the basic form of real world abstraction through to a comprehensive set of data interoperability. The GNM adapts this and describes the basic concepts that underpin and define the Common Transport Application Schema upon which all five themes are based. The GCM relies on ISO standards and the 19xxx series in particular.

The purpose of this document is to specify a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Transport Networks_ as defined in Annex I of the INSPIRE Directive.

However each organisation will have different responsibilities from the next and this will influence the kind of data they collect and manage and use. In turn some organisations may use simple models; others by necessity will have complex data arrangements. This data specification is provided as basic framework which users can adopt and if required â€“ extend for themselves.

The model is structured to maximise reuse and the sharing of organisational data about a network. The specification is concerned only with the core spatial objects required by _Transport Networks_ (while acknowledging that the boundary of any object grouping is never black and white).

Figure 2 below outlines the scope of the specification and how it relates to associated spatial objects which are less generically used.

image::./media/image5.png[image,width=512,height=306, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 2 â€“ Scope of Transport Network data*

_Spatial Objects (core â€“ application specific)_

This specification is mainly focussed on the "widely reused â€“ widely referenced" segment of spatial objects (ie network centrelines etc.). *It does not attempt to try and incorporate every spatial object that might be used by any application*. In *Figure 2 â€“ Scope of Transport Network data* above such objects maybe lighting columns, gantries, signals, sensors etc. These are all of the type "application specific "â€“ and will be used/referenced by at least one organisation.

_Associated "non-Geographic" data_

Any "non geographic data" (the majority of the data holdings in any organisation) â€“ is also out of scope of this specification â€“ such records maybe "an asset condition report", "traffic flow records", "images of assets", "statistics", "timetables", "noise data" and so on. Therefore much of the data used in the telematics industry is classed application specific. While associated with the network all these examples are closer to the application end of the spectrum than generic use by a wide community whether they represent a geographic entity or non-geographic data.

To maximise reuse the linkage of such organisational data with the spatial objects should be "loose" in the sense that these are ideally defined as different data objects in a database. Configured correctly such data may then reused in several different applications and any associated information shared and exchanged as desired.

_User defined views and flexibility_

The model itself is flexible and will permit a cross organisational approach where different users may collect and use different kinds of information about a network. By referencing they can relate one "view" e.g. a highway name, classification, route, condition survey and so on â€“ simply by using references against a common geographic framework. Methods that will be found within the GNM that support this are the "linkset" and "link sequence". Any third party may further add their own "views", thereby enabling greater reuse and easier exchange of information around a common standard set of information components.

This approach enables several organisations to contribute and easily combine several views of the transport network. For a road example the combinations and contributors might be:


_Underlying link and node geometry: mapping agency (national or state level)_
_Highway name: municipality_
_National highway classification: national highway authority_
_European highway classification: European highway authority_


Many of these contributors may also collect and maintain application objects and business data which can be linked to the same infrastructure.

_Extensibility_ 
Users can extend the schema and add their own spatial objects to support an application. Data architects should use the GCM as the basis for any such extension. To illustrate this a small number of objects that are primarily of an application need (than generic) are included in this specification. Examples of these are:

* Linear â€“ speed limits in the Roads theme
* Point â€“ kilometer posts on the Roads and Rail
* Area* - Port area, Railway station area, etc.

_*In practice these areas may be defined by aggregations of some other area object types using objects from other themes e.g. buildings._

_Applications and use cases_

While INSPIRE is primarily an environmental directive, _Transport Networks_ data enjoys a wide variety of applications as recognised in the footnote to the theme statement in Annex I of the Directive. The following use cases are highlighted to demonstrate the width and breadth of applications (the list is not exhaustive).

* Asset Management
* Capacity Planning
* Construction
* Design & Planning
* Disaster management
* Emergency response
* *Environmental Impact Assessments (incl. Noise)*
* Estate management
* Flow modelling

The applications *in bold* above were used as use cases in the preparation of this specification. These represent applications at the European, national, local public sector levels and in the private sector. It is evident that the scope of the specific does not attempt to support all these applications. User extensibility is supported and encouraged. Future revisions may incorporate further object types if it is felt that further standardisation is necessary.

_Characteristics of the specification_

The key characteristics of the _Transport Networks_ datasets are:

* They contain information of specific interest for the public sector in its role to support economic growth through efficient transportation, passenger safety, environÂ­mental impacts and social planning, etc.

* The information is applicable from local to European levels of operation.

* The data represents a structure or methods of operation that is stable over time (even if parts of the data content frequently changes).

* Supports cross border (pan-European) applications.

* Being a part of the European Spatial Data Infrastructure the data may be more easily used with other kinds of data themes, such as geographical names, administrative units, and addresses etc.

* Private sector applications are extensive.


*Local to European level capability*

From the use case list above it is evident that the specification has wide application and at several levels. Many applications would like to move seamlessly from the macro to micro view but this is rarely possible today for many reasons â€“ chiefly today's datasets were not designed to operate in that way.

_Local, Regional, National and European relevance of the specification_

The datasets in scope are used extensively at the "local level" and extend to regional, national and European levels. Usage can change with levels of operation or within an organisation. The specification is mainly focussed on establishing a more coherent approach to those datasets that universally used, probably held at national or regional level and at the highest resolution within this context. This section describes the context within this respect.

_Area and link types of representation at the higher resolution level_

Some applications require a centreline network approach, some require the extent of carriageway or other form of transport, and some applications use both forms of representation. These are alternative forms of representation of a real world entity. The specification therefore supports alternative forms of representation and these may be cross referenced to support easy data exchange between the two. Only the centreline (link) can be formed into network (e.g. using the linkset).

_Seamless resolution representations at the local and regional level_

In these and other domains lower resolution representations may be preferred e.g. to view traffic flows in a region or capacity of the network. A user may wish to zoom from city level to a specific street seamlessly. Such an approach is recognised in D2.5 and outlined in D2.6. However such data management processes and methodologies remain immature. Ideally the lower resolution datasets would be derived from the local/high resolution data - outlined in the previous paragraph â€“ and referenced (no geographic) data could then be aggregated and disaggregated as desired.

_Multiple representations at regional, national and European levels._

Ideally the same data would be scalable dynamically from local to European level seamlessly. Since the current datasets and methods are insufficiently mature to support this - several "levels of detail" will usually be stored to represent the network at different operational levels.

Unfortunately today there is very little correspondence between each level. Ideally it would be easy to seamlessly move from the highest to the lowest resolution with corresponding scaling and aggregation and disaggregation of the associated organisational information (as we do on statistical datasets) e.g. for reporting purposes or trans European analysis, real time management, planning and policy making.

Such a "multiple resolution" approach is discussed in D2.6 Annex A.19 and Annex B.1 of this document. Transport networks lend themselves to such an approach.

In the meantime this specification applies to all levels of detail. Further proving of the approach is required to support truly seamless integration of the levels of detail*. In the meantime data providers are encouraged to introduce this specification at the local level as a priority.

[.small]#_*It is reported that some organisations are currently investigating such an approach but it is not yet formally adopted to such a level to document it in this version of the_ Transport networks _specification (TN specification). This is an area that requires further research to improve both the capability and automation potential._#

*Overview Structure of the _Transport Networks_ data product specification and commentary on specific issues within the specification*

_Structure_

The structure follows the ISO standard for data specifications (ISO 19xxx). Sections 1-3 are prepared to a defined pattern for all themes. Section 5 contains a combination of the outputs from the UML model (application schemas) for the Common Transport Model and each of the five themes. This is supplemented by a descriptive narrative. Sections 6 â€“ 11 are largely harmonised across all themes with variations that are essential to support aspects of this theme. The Annexes are informative and include the Abstract Test Suite and further background information and examples.

_Linear Referencing_

Linear referencing is incorporated in the specification. This uses an approach aligned with the ISO 19148:2012; which establishes linear referencing within a spatial environment (rather than a traditional standalone approach). The aim of this is to better support data sharing across referencing mechanisms, and to offer coordinates for any object referenced linearly, in the same national coordinate system.

_Logical networks_

Logical networks (see Annex B.1) can be used within the model but their spatial value is very limited or in some cases may be non-existent. Therefore caution is required. Where these are in operation alongside the above forms of representation it is suggested that any corresponding nodes are reused or at least cross referenced to provide a relationship between the systems to preserve the potential for data sharing and exchange where that is both relevant and appropriate.

_Network Interconnections_

There are several cases where networks need to be joined up. For example at national, regional or dataset boundaries and at intermodal points within networks. This is provided by the Network Connection component which is defined in the Generic Network Model.

_Relationships with other themes_

There are linkages to other themes. In particular:


_Hydrography_ [HY] â€“ the water transport theme reuses the INSPIRE river network model, for inland transportation purposes. To avoid undue interference with the river network - connections link inland ports with the nearest node on the river network. In marine waters the model is influenced by specifications from the International Hydrographic Office [IHO].

_Addresses_ [AD] â€“ the majority of addresses are linked to transport links (roads, some rivers etc) and thoroughfares are not part of the transport network defined in this specifications (e.g. pedestrian ways). However there is no link shown in the TN model â€“ this is more logically made from the address to the transport object to which it is associated. The primary purpose for such a link would be to ensure consistency of geographic highway/thoroughfare name and to support address to address navigation via transport networks.


_Source material_

The _Transport Networks_ data product specification (TN DPS) has been developed using the reference material, expertise and dialogue with LMO and SDIC. Other material submitted by LMO/SDIC has been supplemented by research to fill in the gaps in evidence. The TN specification is extensive and has therefore been broken into five interoperable transport themes: _Road, Rail, Water_, _Air transport and Cableway networks_.

_Topology_

Topology is handled implicitly rather than explicitly in the entire transport schema. This is to keep the model simple as possible. Generally systems will build topology in a form that best meets the user's application. *_It is expected that most applications will use the network data within a topological environment._*

There is therefore a prerequisite for "implicit topology". This means that the data provided must be sufficiently clean and capable of automated topological construction within a user's application. There are therefore specific data capture requirements and these are described in Chapter 7 on Data Quality and in Chapter 10 on Data Capture.

_Future Updates of this specification_

It is intended that this specification will be maintained in accordance with current proposals outlined by the Data Specifications Drafting Team. It is not possible to state at this time when the next update will occur.

=== How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 3 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

*Figure 3 - Relationship between INSPIRE Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines*

==== Requirements

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Transport Networks_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme Transport Networks in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:


[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X* 

This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.

====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.


[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X* 

Recommendations are shown using this style.

====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

<<<
== Specification scopes

This data specification does not distinguish different specification scopes, but just considers one general scope.

NOTE For more information on specification scopes, see [ISO 19131:2007], clause 8 and Annex D.

<<<
== Identification information

These Technical Guidelines are identified by the following URI:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/tg/tn/3.2rc1

NOTE ISO 19131 suggests further identification information to be included in this section, e.g. the title, abstract or spatial representation type. The proposed items are already described in the document metadata, executive summary, overview description (section 2) and descriptions of the application schemas (section 5). In order to avoid redundancy, they are not repeated here.

== Data content and structure

=== Application schemas â€“ Overview 

==== Application schemas included in the IRs

Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Implementing Rules lay down the requirements for the content and structure of the data sets related to the INSPIRE Annex themes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 4_
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme Transport Networks are defined in the following application schemas (see sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8):

* Common Transport Elements application schema
* Air Transport Network application schema
* Cable Transport Network application schema
* Railway Transport Network application schema
* Road Transport Network application schema
* Water Transport Network application schema

image::./media/image7.png[image,width=604,height=516, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 4 â€“ UML class diagram: Overview of the _Transport Networks_ UML structure and dependencies*

The dependencies between the different Transport Networks application schemas are illustrated in Figure 4. All five of the Transport Networks (Road, Rail, Cable, Water and Air) application schemas depend on the Common Transport Elements application schema which defines a number of common transport classes. In turn, Common Transport Elements depends on the Generic Network Model on which it is based.

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

NOTE The application schemas presented in this section contain some additional information that is not included in the Implementing Rules, in particular multiplicities of attributes and association roles.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 1*

Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the multiplicities defined for the attributes and association roles in this section.

====

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema â€“ across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 5_
*Types*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.

. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 1 below.

[.text-center]
*Table 1 â€“ Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[cols=",,",options="header"]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided â€“ either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the Â«voidableÂ» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the Â«voidableÂ» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=5]
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

. Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:
[loweralpha]
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;
.. code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 2*

Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.

. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 3*

Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows.
+
INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>/<value>.


* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined.
+
Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists.
+
The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:
+
** The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.
** The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".
** In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.
** The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones.

+
Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.


[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 4*

The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<UpperCamelCaseName>_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "\{complete,disjoint}".

*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.

. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

====

NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier which is published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. [DS-D2.5]

NOTE 2 Article 9(1) is implemented in each application schema by including the attribute _inspireId_ of type Identifier.

NOTE 3 Article 9(2) is ensured if the _namespace_ and _localId_ attributes of the Identifier remains the same for different versions of a spatial object; the _version_ attribute can of course change.

(ed.), OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information â€“ Simple feature access â€“ Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

=== Application schema Common Transport Elements

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The Common Transport Elements application schema covers elements that are shared by subthemes _Road, Rail, Cable, Water_ and _Air_. These subthemes have been modelled as separate application schemas within the Transport Networks theme.

Many of the common transport elements are specializations of common definitions for networks and network elements available in the GNM. Elements in networks are handled as nodes, links, aggregated links, areas and points.

Cross-border connectivity (connections between networks across national and regional borders) is also included. It uses a mechanism provided by the GNM and inherited by the specific transport network classes. Using the same mechanism from the GNM, intermodal connectivity (connections between elements in networks which use a different mode of transport) may also be included.

The Common Transport Elements application schema also defines a number of common transport property classes (as specializations of the generic Network Property class in the GNM). These classes are used to describe properties of transport network elements and they can apply to the whole of the network element they are associated with or - for linear features - be described using linear referencing.

The primary aspects modelled for transport network elements are:

* Spatial. Geometric (point, line and surface (i.e. areas (topographic areas)) representation of various elements that are parts of a network. Typically, the network is handled as a network of connected linear elements (links) with optional points (nodes) at the ends of the lines (at junctions, road ends etc). Also, points (other than nodes) and areas with a function in a network may be represented in the dataset.
* Temporal. All elements in a network may have a temporal validity (i.e. description of when the network element exists in the real world) and also information on when data was entered, modified or deleted in the dataset.
* Thematic. Depending on subtheme, the specializations for nodes, links and areas can be further characterized through various types of attributes and/or links to common or subtheme-specific property types.

===== UML Overview

As illustrated by Figure 5, many of the important mechanisms that are used to properly describe a transport network are defined by the GNM, and inherited by components of the transport network application schemas. Although these classes and relationships only appear in the informative paragraphs about imported types in the Transport Networks specification, they are very important for a correct implementation of this specification.

They include:

* The relationships between Nodes, Links, Link Sequences and Link Sets,
* Network Properties and the different ways of linking them to an element of a (transport) network,
* The mechanism for cross-border and intermodal connections,
* Grade separated crossings.

NOTE In Figure 5, only the most important relationships between the Common Transport Networks application schema and the GNM are shown. Not all classes are present in the diagram and most of the attributes are removed in the intrest of clarity.

In the following paragraphs, the use of these mechanisms will be further explained.

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

As described in D2.6 A.18 there are three topic areas regarding consistency between spatial data sets, these are:

[loweralpha]
. Coherence between spatial objects of the same theme at different levels of detail
. Coherence between different spatial objects within a same area
. Coherence at state boundaries.


[a] For _Transport networks_ the specification incorporates two alternative forms of representation:

* Physical topographic area objects (usually surveyed to a high accuracy)
* Centreline representations (often an approximation of the centreline)

At any level of detail data integrity demands that these two forms need to be consistent with each other both positionally and logically. For example, where both exist, a road centreline will always fall within the limits of the corresponding road area object. Similarly, nodes in the road centreline representation will always fall inside the road area object that corresponds to the topographic junction where the node occurs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 7.9.1_
*Theme-specific Requirements â€“ Consistency between spatial data sets*

. Transport Networks centreline representations and nodes shall always be located within the extent of the area representation of the same object

====

[b] Both forms of representation will often be combined with other themes in a wide variety of applications. Again data integrity demands that these should be positionally consistent to ensure both a faithful representation of the real world and a professional appearance that will fill the user with confidence. For example buildings, rivers and forests with the transportation system.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 6*

The objects in the Transport Networks theme should be positionally consistent with spatial objects from other themes (e.g. with buildings and rivers, forestry extents)

====

[c] It is essential that continuity of transport network information is preserved positionally, logically and semantically across state borders and â€“ where applicable â€“ also across regional borders within member states. This is vital to interoperable pan-European spatial information. The methods to support this are outlined in D2.6 Annex B.

The GNM provides a simple cross-referencing system to establish cross-border connections between Transport Networks. In practice, this is done by linking a transport network element in a data set on one side of the border and the connected or corresponding network element in a data set on the other side of the border to a Network Connection object which has been qualified as cross-border connected (when the linked network elements connect to each other) or as cross-border identical (when the linked network elements are representations in each data set of the same real world object). The Network Connection class is defined in the GNM.

image::./media/image14.png[CrossBorderConnections,width=604,height=324]

[.text-center]
*Figure 11 â€“ Examples of cross-border connections between Transport Networks*

For Transport Networks the use of a Network Connection to establish cross-border connectivity is mandatory. Furthermore, it is recommended that the respective authorities seek to fully resolve the positional alignment of cross-border connected elements of Transport Networks in accordance to the rules for network connectivity outlined in section 10.2 (Ensuring Network Connectivity).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 7.9.1_
*Theme-specific Requirements â€“ Consistency between spatial data sets*

[arabic, start=2]
. Connectivity between Transport Networks across state borders and â€“ where applicable â€“ also across regional borders (and data sets) within Member States shall be established and maintained by the respective authorities, using the cross-border connectivity mechanisms provided by the NetworkConnection type.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 7*

In considering reconciliation across borders the respective authorities should seek to fully resolve the positional alignment that minimises positional deficiencies that would require repeated manual interval in updates or detract from the use of the data in applications.

====

===== Identifier management

As is required by the GCM, all spatial objects must have a unique identifier. This must be persistent and will usually be supported by a defined lifecycle to ensure that users understand the conditions that the identifier may be created, modified (in terms of its relationship with the spatial object) and deleted.

The unique object identifier will be modelled on the form described in D2.5 9.8.2 and 9.7 and D2.7 Chapter 7 where a country code and namespace is applied as a prefix to the existing local identifier used by the authority responsible for the data. This will both ensure that the identifier is:

* Unique in the European spatial data infrastructure
* The object is traceable in that infrastructure

All spatial objects in the _Transport networks_ will have a unique object identifier â€“ this includes those spatial objects that contain geometry and those that may not (e.g. Associated objects, AggregatedLink objects and those defined by linear referencing etc).

All spatial objects in the Transport Networks themes have a persistent unique identifier as defined in the INSPIRE documents D2.5 and D2.7.

NOTE All spatial object classes in the Transport Networks application schemas inherit their unique identifier from the GNM where it is defined with a cardinality of "0..1". In the transport networks classes the unique identifier is mandatory for all objects, which corresponds to a cardinality of "1".

Ideally all objects should be supported by a defined lifecycle model and a method of versioning (see D2.5 9.7) that assists the user in distinguishing between current objects and previous versions.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 8*

The spatial object unique identifier should be supported by a documented lifecycle to provide users with a defined behaviour pattern as conditions which affect the object change over time.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 9*

The spatial object unique identifier should be supported by a defined form of versioning to ensure that users refer to the correct version in applications.

====

===== Modelling of object references

The INSPIRE Directive promotes the reuse of information. Object referencing is designed to support that aim whereby an existing object e.g. a transport link is used by several other objects, which may be collected by different organisations (e.g. surface condition survey, speed limit/restrictions etc). Such objects would normally inherit geometry from underlying referenced objects.

*Data Association*

As described in D2.5 Chapter 13 an associated object would reference the base network (data association). The link is physically achieved by cross referencing one object with another â€“ using the unique identifiers provided (and ideally the version information),

This is common practice in several existing transport networks and the _Transport networks_ specification supports this approach.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 10*

All associated spatial objects in the Transport Networks theme should use object referencing to an existing set of transport links rather than duplicate the geometry.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 11*

All centreline spatial objects in the Transport Networks theme should use object referencing to the topographic area objects to support both data sharing of application data and the support synchronisation of the two representations over time.

====

*Transport properties and linear referencing*

Many of the thematic properties of the Transport Networks objects are defined as Transport Properties. All Transport Property classes are subtypes of the GNM Network Property class. As such, they inherit the mechanisms that are defined in the GNM to link them to transport network elements (such as Transport links, Transport Link Sequences, Transport Link Sets, Transport Nodes and Transport Areas) using object referencing.

Transport Properties also offer a way the easily extend the Transport Networks specification. For different applications, additional Transport Property classes can be defined and linked to the appropriate Network Elements.

A Transport Property can be linked to an entire transport element or, when the target is a Transport Link or â€“ more typically â€“ a Transport Link Sequence, to part of it using linear referencing.

Linear referencing is included in the GNM (ISO 19148:2012) (see also Chapter 10.2) and a simple approach is included until the standard is more widely used. This can be of value in many applications where a consistent approach to data capture and referencing is absent today for example speed limit extents as shown in Figure 12 below.

image::./media/image15.png[LinearReferencingExample,width=605,height=413]

[.text-center]
*Figure 12 â€“ example of linear referencing to locate the start and end of a speed restriction zone.*

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 12*

Linear referencing should be adopted to support the location of changes in condition or other phenomena along a link or link sequence where there is no requirement to disturb the link and node structure

====

Linear referencing is used to position phenomena along a linear object, using a distance from the beginning of the linear object. Some systems disconnect the linear reference from the geometry of the linear object in the dataset, adding a calibrated linear coordinate to the object, corresponding to the distance measured along the real world object or interpolated between fixed marker posts (which themselves may not be exactly located at the distance they indicate).

For Transport Networks, all supplied linear references will use the distance along the geometry of the linear object in the database.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 7.9.2_
*Theme-specific Requirements â€“ Modelling of object references*

. When linear referencing is used in Transport Networks data, the position of referenced properties on links and link sequences shall be expressed as distances measured along the supplied geometry of the underlying link object(s).

====

*Intermodal connections*

The Transport Networks specification inherits a simple approach to intermodal connections from the GNM that has been adopted in the absence of any commonly adopted standards. Spatial objects within the Transport Networks specification can be linked (cross-referenced) to support connectivity between any two transport networks that use different modes of transport. This is to support journey planning, navigation etc.

In practice, intermodal connections can be established by linking two transport network elements (from different transport networks which use a different mode of transport) to a Network Connection object which is qualified as an intermodal connection. The Network Connection class is defined in the GNM.

Several types of transport network elements, including links, link sequences, link sets, areas and nodes can participate in intermodal connections. The use of nodes is recommended since this allows for a more accurate positioning of the connection in the two networks.

Figure 13 demonstrates the concept of the intermodal connection. In this example, a node in a road transport network is connected to a node in the railway network. These nodes may, but do not have to, share the same location.

[arabic, start=2]
. An inter-modal connection shall always reference two elements which belong to different networks.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 13*

An inter-modal connection should be established between transport nodes.

====

===== Geometry representation

There are three types of geometry in this specification:

[loweralpha]
. (Topographic) Area objects in Transport Networks
. Centreline objects in Transport Networks
. Point objects in Transport Networks

Types (a) and (b) may be alternative representations of the same real world phenomena about which the user can associate their own information (objects) â€“ See Annex B1 for more background.

Type (c) is, apart from network nodes, only included in the specification for marker posts. However users may wish to collect such data and associate it with the network (e.g. the location of network infrastructure components e.g. traffic lights, lighting columns, beacons, navigation lights etc).

The geometric basis of a transport network consists of a number of *connected* linear elements (Transport Links) with optional point elements (Transport Nodes) at the ends of the lines (at junctions, terminals, etc).

Section 10.2 (Ensuring Network Connectivity) contains the necessary rules for ensuring connectivity within Transport Networks. Connections between Transport Networks are established by using the cross-border and intermodal connection mechanisms present in the GNM and further explained in sections 5.3.1.3 (Consistency between spatial data sets) and 5.3.1.5 (Modelling of object references) respectively.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 7.9.3_
*Theme-specific Requirements â€“ Geometry representation*

. Transport link ends shall be connected wherever an intersection exists between the real world phenomena they represent. No connections shall be created at crossing network elements when it is not possible to pass from one element to another.

====

*NOTE* Grade separated crossings can be modeled using the GradeSeparatedCrossing class from the GNM. This class enables the ordered linking of two (Transport) Links. In this ordered relationship, the first Link is always the lower of the two.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 14*

In Transport Networks data, Transport Nodes should be present wherever Transport Links connect or end

====

If a Transport Networks data set contains nodes, they can only occur where a connection exists between two Transport Links or where a Transport Link ends (end or dangle node). Nodes shall not occur where two links cross but not intersect, for instance at grade separated crossings.
*NOTE* An AirNode is not necessarily placed at the end or start of a Transport Link when it is not used for navigation/ATS purposes.
Example: an AerodromeNode could either simply represent the aerodrome location (significantPoint = false) or act as transport node for connectivity (significantPoint = true).

[IMPORTANT]
====

*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 7.9.3_
*Theme-specific Requirements â€“ Geometry representation*

[arabic, start=2]
. In a Transport Networks data set which contains nodes, these nodes shall only be present where Transport Links connect or end.

====

|===
|An AirNode is not required to be present where Transport Links connect or end when it is not intended for navigation/ATS purposes i.e., when its significantPoint attribute is set to 'false'.
|===

The individual Transport Links can be combined to form Transport Link Sequences, using the mechanism provided by the GNM. As an ordered sequence of Transport Links, Transport Link Sequences have no geometry of their own. Their position is defined by the composing Transport Links.

Transport Link Sequences and/or Transport Links can be further combined to form Transport Link Sets. This way, looped and forked elements of a transport network can be represented. Like Transport Link Sequences, Transport Link Sets have no geometry of their own.

image::./media/image17.png[LinkSequenceSet,width=604,height=355]

[.text-center]
*Figure 14 â€“Example of the use of Link, Node, Link Sequence and Link Set*

*Levels of detail:* The specification addresses the highest resolution of data capture in Transport Networks and is also applicable to any derived lower resolution levels of detail where the number of coordinates is reduced and the geometry simplified to support viewing and reporting at regional, national and European levels. See also Chapter D10.4 and Annex B.1

This specification cannot advise on the form of representation at the highest resolution nor the accuracy since this will be driven by member state needs. Ideally derived lower resolution datasets will use the approach outlined in D2.6 A.19 where all the objects are related from lowest to highest resolution and any user information collected about the network can be simply aggregated at the lower resolution level or disaggregated as the user increases the resolution.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 15* 

All Transport Networks spatial objects should be provided at the source resolution (and accuracy) where possible.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 16* 

Lower order resolutions should be derived from the highest order representation of the transport network, and any user information captured once and referenced to each geometrical representation

====

NOTE The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in OGC 06-103r3).

===== Temporality representation

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 17*

If information about the actual start and end of the existence of transport network elements is not maintained as part of the spatial data set, all spatial objects belonging to this data set should provide a void value with a reason of "unknown".

====

===== Notes on constraints for transport properties

NOTE 1 The application schemas in this section specify constraints on transport properties restricting the transport objects the transport property can be associated with. In some cases, these constraints allow the transport property to be associated only with very specific types, while in other cases they refer only very generally to spatial objects that are part of a specific (e.g. road or rail) transport network. In some cases, the more specific restriction is already indicated in the name of the constraint (e.g. "Applies to WaterwayLink and WaterwayNode only"), while the natural language description is less specific (e.g. "This property can only be associated with a spatial object that is part of a water transport network."). Ideally, these mismatches should be removed, while following the general rule that the constraints should be as specific as possible. This will be proposed in a future update of the Regulation on spatial data sets and services as well as this guidelines document.

NOTE 2 In cases where there is a mismatch between the name of the constraint and its natural language description, the OCL constraint already reflects the more specific restriction. In these cases, while the natural language description is consistent with the Regulation on spatial data sets and services, the OCL constraint already reflects the intended update of the (natural language descriptions of the) constraint.

=== Application schema Road Transport Networks

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The _Road Transport Networks application_ schema (Roads Schema) employs a link and node structure to represent a road system used for the transportation of vehicles in the form of a linear network. The Roads Schema inherits classes from the Common Transport Schema and also creates its own classes to describe properties of the road network such as Ownership and traffic direction that can apply to whole sections of the network element or subsections that can be described using linear referencing.

The primary aspects modelled for road network elements are:

* Spatial. Geometric (point, line and area (topographic)) representation of various elements that are parts of a network. Typically, the network is handled as a network of connected linear elements (links) with points (nodes) at the ends of the lines (at junctions, road ends etc). Also real objects with a function in a network may be represented in the dataset. Network connectivity within the roads network is essential but between elements in the other networks is an optional spatial aspect.
* Temporal. All elements in a network may have a temporal validity (i.e. description of when the network element exists in the real world) and also optional information on when data was entered, modified or deleted in the dataset.
* Thematic. The road schema can be thematically displayed via several of the attributes defined within the specification such as ownerAuthority or speedLimits.

=== Application schema Rail Transport Networks

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The Rail Transport Networks application schema (Rail Schema) employs a link and node structure to represent the rail tracks used for transportation in the form of a linear network. The Rail Schema inherits classes from the Common Transport Schema and also creates its own classes to describe properties of the rail network such as Ownership and restrictions that can apply to whole sections of the network element or subsections that can be described using linear referencing.

The primary aspects modelled for rail network elements are:

* Spatial. Geometric (point, line and area (topographic)) representation of various elements that are parts of a network. Typically, the network is handled as a network of connected linear elements (links) with points (nodes) at the ends of the lines (at junctions, rail ends etc). Also real objects with a function in a network may be represented in the dataset. Network connectivity within the rail network is essential but between elements in the other networks is an optional spatial aspect.
* Temporal. All elements in a network may have a temporal validity (i.e. description of when the network element exists in the real world) and also optional information on when data was entered, modified or deleted in the dataset.
* Thematic. The Rail Schema can be thematically displayed via several of the attributes defined within the specification such as railwayGauge or owningAuthority.

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

All requirements and recommendations on transport networks, defined in the Common Transport Elements application schema (see section 5.3.1.3) apply to the corresponding specialized elements/classes in the _Rail transport networks_.

===== Identifier management

All requirements and recommendations on transport networks, defined in the Common Transport Elements application schema (see section 5.3.1.4) apply to the corresponding specialized elements/classes in the _Rail transport networks_.

===== Modelling of object references

All requirements and recommendations on transport networks, defined in the Common Transport Elements application schema (see section 5.3.1.5) apply to the corresponding specialized elements/classes in the _Rail transport networks_.

===== Geometry representation

All requirements and recommendations on transport networks, defined in the Common Transport Elements application schema (see section 5.3.1.6) apply to the corresponding specialized elements/classes in the _Rail transport networks_.

===== Temporality representation

All attributes describing the lifespan of spatial objects or the phenomena in the real world they describe are inherited from the Common Transport Elements application schema. Refer to section 5.3.1.7 for more information.

=== Application schema Cable Transport Networks

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The Cable Transport Networks application schema (Cable Schema) employs a link and node structure to represent the cableways used for transportation of hung vehicles in the form of a linear network. It can play an important role especially in isolated areas having none or difficult access by means of other types of transport (e.g. mountain areas). The Cable Schema inherits classes from the Common Transport Elements application schema, including the possibility to create classes to describe properties of the cableway network and restrictions that can apply to whole sections of the network element or subsections that can be described using linear referencing. This type of network is modelled in a basic way in the specifications.

The primary aspects modelled for cableway network elements are:

* Spatial. Geometric (point and line) representation of various elements that are parts of a network. Typically, the network is handled as a network of connected linear elements (links) with points (nodes) at the ends of the lines (at junctions, cable ends etc). Also real objects with a function in a network may be represented in the dataset. Network connectivity within the cable network is essential but between elements in the other networks is an optional spatial aspect.
* Temporal. All elements in a network may have a temporal validity (i.e. description of when the network element exists in the real world) and also optional information on when data was entered, modified or deleted in the dataset.
* Thematic. The Cable Schema can be thematically enriched through the use of Transport Properties as defined in the Common Transport Elements application schema.

=== Application schema Water Transport Networks

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The _Water transport network_ schema employs a link and node structure to represent navigable waterways and ports within water bodies (main marine waterways and ships routeing systems - traffic separation schemes - at the sea, and inland waterways defined across rivers and canals) allowing transportation in the form of a linear network. The water transport network reuse the centreline geometry of the _Hydrography_ theme's network (hydrographic network) of rivers and canals as the basis for most inland water transport. However, when this is not enough to describe it properly, specific water transport network's centrelines can also be used (waterway links), in combination to the previous ones, in order to complete the network. The water schema also inherits classes from the Common Transport Schema and also creates its own classes to describe properties of the water network such as water traffic flow direction and any restrictions that can apply to whole sections of the network element or subsections that can be described using linear referencing.

The primary aspects modelled for water network elements are:

* Spatial. Geometric (point, line and area (topographic)) representation of various elements that are parts of a network. Typically, the network is handled as a network of connected linear elements (links) with points (nodes) at the ends of the lines (at junctions, ports etc). Also real objects with a function in a network may be represented in the dataset. Network connectivity within the water network is essential but between elements in the other networks is an optional spatial aspect.
* Temporal. All elements in a network may have a temporal validity (i.e. description of when the network element exists in the real world) and also optional information on when data was entered, modified or deleted in the dataset.
* Thematic. The water schema can be thematically displayed via several of the attributes defined within the specification such as CEMTClass.

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

All requirements and recommendations on transport networks, defined in the Common Transport Elements application schema (see section 5.3.1.3) apply to the corresponding specialized elements/classes in the _Water transport networks_.

===== Identifier management

All requirements and recommendations on transport networks, defined in the Common Transport Elements application schema (see section 5.3.1.4) apply to the corresponding specialized elements/classes in the _Water transport networks_.

===== Modelling of object references

All requirements and recommendations on transport networks, defined in the Common Transport Elements application schema (see section 5.3.1.5) apply to the corresponding specialized elements/classes in the _Water transport networks_.

In particular the _Water transport networks_ theme reuses the existing water network in the _Hydrography_ theme for the majority of the inland _Water transport networks_ geometry. This is a case of object referencing.

[IMPORTANT]

*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 7.9.4_
*Theme-specific Requirements â€“ Modelling of object references*

The Water transport networks shall re-use, where it exists and is practicable, the water network centreline geometry of the Hydrography theme. Therefore, object referencing shall be used to link the water transport course with the existing water network geometry in the Hydrography theme.

=== Application schema Air Transport Networks

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The Air Transport Networks application schema (Air Schema) employs a link and node structure to represent the Air routes used for transportation in the form of a linear network. The Air Schema inherits classes from the Common Transport Schema and also creates its own classes to describe properties of the air network such as air route type and restrictions that can apply to whole sections of the network element or subsections that can be described using linear referencing.

The primary aspects modelled for air network elements are:

* Spatial. Geometric (point, line and area (topographic)) representation of various elements that are parts of a network. Typically, the network is handled as a network of connected linear elements (links) with points (nodes) at the air route junctions (usually over the position of significant points, such as navigation aids and designated points) or at the ends of the lines (at aerodromes â€“ airports or heliports). Also real objects with a function in a network may be represented in the dataset. Network connectivity within the roads and rail networks (where this exists) is essential but between elements in the other networks is an optional spatial aspect.
* Temporal. All elements in a network may have a temporal validity (i.e. description of when the network element exists in the real world) and also optional information on when data was entered, modified or deleted in the dataset.
* Thematic. The air schema can be thematically displayed via several of the attributes defined within the specification such as altitude.

====

===== Display

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.4_
*Coordinate Reference Systems used in the View Network Service*

For the display of spatial data sets with the view network service as specified in Regulation No 976/2009, at least the coordinate reference systems for two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude) shall be available.

====

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.5_
*Coordinate Reference System Identifiers*

. Coordinate reference system parameters and identifiers shall be managed in one or several common registers for coordinate reference systems.

. Only identifiers contained in a common register shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems listed in this Section.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to use the http URIs provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium as coordinate reference system identifiers (see identifiers for the default CRSs in the INSPIRE coordinate reference systems register). These are based on and redirect to the definition in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry (_http://www.epsg-registry.org/_).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 2*

The identifiers listed in the INSPIRE coordinate reference systems register (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/crs) shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems used in a data set.

====

NOTE CRS identifiers may be used e.g. in:

* data encoding,
* data set and service metadata, and
* requests to INSPIRE network services.

==== Temporal reference system

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 11_
*Temporal Reference Systems*

. The default temporal reference system referred to in point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (footnote:[OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12.]) shall be used, unless other temporal reference systems are specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE 1 Point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (the INSPIRE Metadata IRs) states that the default reference system shall be the Gregorian calendar, with dates expressed in accordance with ISO 8601.

NOTE 2 ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats â€“ Information interchange â€“ Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. The standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears first in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It also provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information across time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

EXAMPLE 1997 (the year 1997), 1997-07-16 (16^th^ July 1997), 1997-07-16T19:20:3001:00 (16^th^ July 1997, 19h 20' 30'', time zone: UTC1)

==== Units of measure

[IMPORTANT]
====

== Data quality

This chapter includes a description of the data quality elements and sub-elements as well as the corresponding data quality measures that should be used to evaluate and document data quality for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Transport Networks_ (section 7.1).

It may also define requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Transport Networks_ (sections 7.2 and 7.3).

In particular, the data quality elements, sub-elements and measures specified in section 7.1 should be used for

* evaluating and documenting data quality properties and constraints of spatial objects, where such properties or constraints are defined as part of the application schema(s) (see section 5);

* evaluating and documenting data quality metadata elements of spatial data sets (see section 8); and/or

* specifying requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Transport Networks_ (see sections 7.2 and 7.3).

The descriptions of the elements and measures are based on Annex D of ISO/DIS 19157 Geographic information â€“ Data quality.

=== Data quality elements

Table 3 lists all data quality elements and sub-elements that are being used in this specification. Data quality information can be evaluated at level of spatial object, spatial object type, dataset or dataset series. The level at which the evaluation is performed is given in the "Evaluation Scope" column.

The measures to be used for each of the listed data quality sub-elements are defined in the following sub-sections.

|Data quality basic measure |Error count

|Description |A sliver is an unintended area that occurs when adjacent surfaces are not digitized properly. The borders of the adjacent surfaces may unintentionally gap or overlap by small amounts to cause a topological error.
|Evaluation scope |data set
|Reporting scope |data set; spatial object type
|Parameter a|
This data quality measure has 2 parameters:

* maximum sliver area size
* thickness quotient

The thickness quotient shall be a real number between 0 and 1. This quotient is determined by the following formula:


T is the thickness quotient

T = 4 Ï€ [area]/[perimeter]^2^

T = 1 value corresponds to a circle that has the largest area/perimeter^2^ value.

T = 0 value corresponds to a line that has the smallest area/perimeter^2^ value.


The thickness quotient is independent of the size of the surface, and the closer the value is to 0, the thinner the selected sliver surfaces shall be.

The maximum area determines the upper limit of a sliver. This is to prevent surfaces with sinuous perimeters and large areas from being mistaken as slivers.

|Description a|
For a number of points (_N_), the measured positions are given as _x~mi~_, _y~mi~_ and _z~mi~_ coordinates depending on the dimension in which the position of the point is measured. A corresponding set of coordinates, _x~ti~_, _y~ti~_ and _z~ti~_, are considered to represent the true positions. The errors are calculated as 1D:

== Dataset-level metadata

This section specifies dataset-level metadata elements, which should be used for documenting metadata for a complete dataset or dataset series.

NOTE Metadata can also be reported for each individual spatial object (spatial object-level metadata). Spatial object-level metadata is fully described in the application schema(s) (section 5).

For some dataset-level metadata elements, in particular those for reporting data quality and maintenance, a more specific scope can be specified. This allows the definition of metadata at sub-dataset level, e.g. separately for each spatial object type (see instructions for the relevant metadata element).

=== Metadata elements defined in INSPIRE Metadata Regulation

Table 4 gives an overview of the metadata elements specified in Regulation 1205/2008/EC (implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata).

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to the relevant section in the Metadata Regulation, which contains a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.
* The fourth column specifies the condition, under which the given element becomes mandatory.

Generic guidelines for implementing these elements using ISO 19115 and 19119 are available at _http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101_. The following sections describe additional theme-specific recommendations and requirements for implementing these elements.

==== Conformity

The _Conformity_ metadata element defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC requires to report the conformance with the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services. In addition, it may be used also to document the conformance to another specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 28*

Dataset metadata should include a statement on the overall conformance of the dataset with this data specification (i.e. conformance with all requirements).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 29*

The _Conformity_ metadata element should be used to document conformance with this data specification (as a whole), with a specific conformance class defined in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A and/or with another specification.

====

The _Conformity_ element includes two sub-elements, the _Specification_ (a citation of the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services or other specification), and the _Degree_ of conformity. The _Degree_ can be _Conformant_ (if the dataset is fully conformant with the cited specification), _Not Conformant_ (if the dataset does not conform to the cited specification) or _Not Evaluated_ (if the conformance has not been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 30*

If a dataset is not yet conformant with all requirements of this data specification, it is recommended to include information on the conformance with the individual conformance classes specified in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 31*

If a dataset is produced or transformed according to an external specification that includes specific quality assurance procedures, the conformity with this specification should be documented using the _Conformity_ metadata element.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 32*

If minimum data quality recommendations are defined then the statement on the conformity with these requirements should be included using the _Conformity_ metadata element and referring to the relevant data quality conformance class in the Abstract Test Suite.

====

NOTE Currently no minimum data quality requirements are included in the IRs. The recommendation above should be included as a requirement in the IRs if minimum data quality requirements are defined at some point in the future.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 33*

When documenting conformance with this data specification or one of the conformance classes defined in the Abstract Test Suite, the _Specification_ sub-element should be given using the http URI identifier of the conformance class or using a citation including the following elements:

* title: "INSPIRE Data Specification on Transport Networks â€“ Draft Guidelines â€“ <name of the conformance class>"

* date:

** dateType: publication

** date: yyyy-mm-dd

==== Lineage

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 34*

Following the ISO/DIS 19157 Quality principles, if a data provider has a procedure for the quality management of their spatial data sets then the appropriate data quality elements and measures defined in ISO/DIS 19157 should be used to evaluate and report (in the metadata) the results. If not, the _Lineage_ metadata element (defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC) should be used to describe the overall quality of a spatial data set.

====

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, lineage "is a statement on process history and/or overall quality of the spatial data set. Where appropriate it may include a statement whether the data set has been validated or quality assured, whether it is the official version (if multiple versions exist), and whether it has legal validity. The value domain of this metadata element is free text".

The Metadata Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119 specifies that the statement sub-element of LI_Lineage (EN ISO 19115) should be used to implement the lineage metadata element.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 35*

To describe the transformation steps and related source data, it is recommended to use the following sub-elements of LI_Lineage:

* For the description of the transformation process of the local to the common INSPIRE data structures, the LI_ProcessStep sub-element should be used.

+ For the description of the source data the LI_Source sub-element should be used.

====

NOTE 1 In order to improve the interoperability, domain templates and instructions for using these free text elements (descriptive statements) may be specified here and/or in an Annex of this data specification.

==== Temporal reference

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, at least one of the following temporal reference metadata sub-elements shall be provided: temporal extent, date of publication, date of last revision, date of creation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 36*

It is recommended that at least the date of the last revision of a spatial data set should be reported using the _Date of last revision_ metadata sub-element.

====

==== MD Element from MD Regulation

=== Metadata elements for interoperability

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 13_
*Metadata required for Interoperability*

The metadata describing a spatial data set shall include the following metadata elements required for interoperability:

. Coordinate Reference System: Description of the coordinate reference system(s) used in the data set.

. Temporal Reference System: ion of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.

. Encoding: Description of the computer language construct(s) specifying the representation of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device or transmission channel.

. Topological Consistency: Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the data set as described by the scope.
+
This element is mandatory only if the data set includes types from the Generic Network Model and does not assure centreline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for the network.

. Character Encoding: The character encoding used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if an encoding is used that is not based on UTF-8.

. Spatial Representation Type: The method used to spatially represent geographic information.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to implement the required metadata elements based on ISO 19115 and ISO/TS 19139.

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with the proposed encoding.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 3*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the used ISO 19139 XML schema.

====

NOTE Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 4*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall contain the elements and meet the INSPIRE multiplicity specified in the sections below.

====

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 5*

The elements specified below shall be available in the specified ISO/TS 19139 path.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 37*

The metadata elements for interoperability should be made available together with the metadata elements defined in the Metadata Regulation through an INSPIRE discovery service.

====

NOTE While this not explicitly required by any of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, making all metadata of a data set available together and through one service simplifies implementation and usability.

==== Metadata elements for reporting data quality

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 40*

For reporting the results of the data quality evaluation, the data quality elements, sub-elements and (for quantitative evaluation) measures defined in chapter 7 should be used.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 41*

The metadata elements specified in the following sections should be used to report the results of the data quality evaluation. At least the information included in the row "Implementation instructions" should be provided.

====

The first section applies to reporting quantitative results (using the element DQ_QuantitativeResult), while the second section applies to reporting non-quantitative results (using the element DQ_DescriptiveResult).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 42*

If a dataset does not pass the tests of the Application schema conformance class (defined in Annex A), the results of each test should be reported using one of the options described in sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2.

====

NOTE 1 If using non-quantitative description, the results of several tests do not have to be reported separately, but may be combined into one descriptive statement.

NOTE 2 The sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2 may need to be updated once the XML schemas for ISO 19157 have been finalised.

The scope for reporting may be different from the scope for evaluating data quality (see section 7). If data quality is reported at the data set or spatial object type level, the results are usually derived or aggregated.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 43*

The scope element (of type DQ_Scope) of the DQ_DataQuality subtype should be used to encode the reporting scope.

Only the following values should be used for the level element of DQ_Scope: Series, Dataset, featureType.

If the level is featureType the levelDescription/MDScopeDescription/features element (of type Set< GF_FeatureType>) shall be used to list the feature type names.

====

NOTE In the level element of DQ_Scope, the value featureType is used to denote spatial object type.

== Delivery

=== Updates

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 8_
*Updates*

. Member States shall make available updates of data on a regular basis.

. All updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set, unless a different period is specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE In this data specification, no exception is specified, so all updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set.

=== Delivery medium

According to Article 11(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for INSPIRE spatial data sets and services. The relevant network service types for making spatial data available are:

* _view services_ making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;
* _download services_, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;
* _transformation services_, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability.

NOTE For the relevant requirements and recommendations for network services, see the relevant Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelinesfootnote:[The Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines on INSPIRE Network Services are available at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/5].

EXAMPLE 1 Through the Get Spatial Objects function, a download service can either download a pre-defined data set or pre-defined part of a data set (non-direct access download service), or give direct access to the spatial objects contained in the data set, and download selections of spatial objects based upon a query (direct access download service). To execute such a request, some of the following information might be required:

* the list of spatial object types and/or predefined data sets that are offered by the download service (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation),

* and the query capabilities section advertising the types of predicates that may be used to form a query expression (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation, where applicable),

* a description of spatial object types offered by a download service instance (to be provided through the Describe Spatial Object Types operation).

EXAMPLE 2 Through the Transform function, a transformation service carries out data content transformations from native data forms to the INSPIRE-compliant form and vice versa. If this operation is directly called by an application to transform source data (e.g. obtained through a download service) that is not yet conformant with this data specification, the following parameters are required:

* Input data (mandatory). The data set to be transformed.

** Source model (mandatory, if cannot be determined from the input data). The model in which the input data is provided.

* Target model (mandatory). The model in which the results are expected.

* Model mapping (mandatory, unless a default exists). Detailed description of how the transformation is to be carried out.

=== Encodings

The IRs contain the following two requirements for the encoding to be used to make data available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 7_
*Encoding*

{empty}1. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall conform to EN ISO 19118. In particular, it shall specify schema conversion rules for all spatial object types and all attributes and association roles and the output data structure used.

{empty}2. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall be made available.

{empty}2a. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall also specify whether and how to represent attributes and association roles for which a corresponding value exists but is not contained in the spatial data sets maintained by a Member State, or cannot be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.


====

NOTE ISO 19118:2011 specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules used for interchange of geographic data within the set of International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". An encoding rule allows geographic information defined by application schemas and standardized schemas to be coded into a system-independent data structure suitable for transport and storage. The encoding rule specifies the types of data being coded and the syntax, structure and coding schemes used in the resulting data structure. Specifically, ISO 19118:2011 includes

* requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas,
* requirements for creating encoding services, and
* requirements for XML-based encoding rules for neutral interchange of data.

While the IRs do not oblige the usage of a specific encoding, these Technical Guidelines propose to make data related to the spatial data theme Transport Networks available at least in the default encoding(s) specified in section 0. In this section, a number of TG requirements are listed that need to be met in order to be conformant with the default encoding(s).

The proposed default encoding(s) meet the requirements in Article 7 of the IRs, i.e. they are conformant with ISO 19118 and (since they are included in this specification) publicly available.

==== Default Encoding(s)

===== Specific requirements for GML encoding

This data specification proposes the use of GML as the default encoding, as recommended in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of [DS-D2.7]. GML is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118, as required in Article 7(1). For details, see [ISO 19136], and in particular Annex E (UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules).

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with GML encodings.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 6*

Data instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the provided XML schema.

NOTE 1 Not all constraints defined in the application schemas can be mapped to XML. Therefore, the following requirement is necessary.

NOTE 2 The obligation to use only the allowed code list values specified for attributes and most of the constraints defined in the application schemas cannot be mapped to the XML sch. They can therefore not be enforced through schema validation. It may be possible to express some of these constraints using other schema or rule languages (e.g. Schematron), in order to enable automatic validation.

== Data Capture

_For every spatial object type: Capturing rules describing the criteria which spatial objects are part of spatial data sets ("selection criteria") as free text. Typical selection criteria are minimum area or length or functional characteristics like the class of a road._

_Data capturing rules are the main element to define the targeted level of detail. For instance, there may be a need for transport networks on two levels of detail (at the European level, scale about 1:1000000 and at the local level, scale about 1:10000) with very similar feature catalogues. However, the data will be very different. This difference is a result of different capturing rules / selection criteria for both levels of detail._

_The data capturing processes used by a data provider, i.e. the "how", are not relevant for this component._

The topics in this chapter highlight specific cases that require specific attention in collecting and assembling data and information that constitutes the components of _Transport networks_ (_Road, Rail, Cable, Water_ and _Air)_.

=== Centrelines

The primary way of representing a network is by a centreline (ie a line that approximates the centre of the real world object. It would be prohibitively expensive and impracticable to faithfully record the true centreline since this would result in an irregular line and far too many data points. Therefore a pragmatic approach is often taken which results in a much smoother line requiring the minimum number of data points to represent the object.

However problems can arise when too few points are used and the line will no longer be smooth or useful in most applications. Equally the centreline may often be combined with (topographic) area objects e.g. the paved or metalled surface, or track. It may also be combined with other themes (e.g. run closely adjacent to a river or another form of transport (railway and road in a narrow gorge for example). It is therefore important that the centreline falls within the physical boundary of the object it represents.

=== Ensuring Network Connectivity

This data specification does not incorporate a topological model for the reasons given in Chapters 4 and 5.1.1.1. Since a users system will build the topology for an application it is essential that the data is captured in such a way that this topology build can be undertaken automatically, repeatedly and faultlessly each time.

Therefore the data has to be supplied to the user with topology "implicit" in the structure (i.e. it must be "clean"). This implicit topology is based on coincidence which does not have to be absolute but relies on a connectivity tolerance. This connectivity tolerance will be supplied as metadata with the transport data. (see Section 7.1.6)

When automatically constructing topological relationships:

* All points, nodes, vertices and link ends that are located at a distance of less than the connectivity tolerance of each other are considered to coincide,
* All points, nodes, vertices and link ends that are located at a distance of more than the connectivity tolerance of each other are considered not to coincide.

To ensure automatic and unambiguous creation of centreline topology:

* All link ends and the optional node that take part in a connection have to be positioned at a distance of less than the connectivity tolerance from each other,
* Link ends and nodes that are not connected shall always be separated by a distance that is greater than the connectivity tolerance.

This will ensure the correct connectivity between links and the nodes in the system. Supporting quality criteria will be found in Section 7.1.6

The three link ends (a, b and c) and the node are all within a distance of less than the connectivity tolerance.

Link end (d) lies within a distance of less than the connectivity tolerance from link end (c), but at a distance greater than the tolerance from link ends (a) and (b) and the transport node.

The connectivity is ambiguous and the topology building would fail.

a|image::./media/image70.png[TopologyOK_2,width=201,height=131] a|
Acceptable (but possible error)

The three link ends (a, b and c) and the node are all within a distance of less than the connectivity tolerance and will be assumed connected during an automatic topology build.

Link end (d) is at a distance greater than the tolerance from all three link ends and the node. It will be considered not connected (dangle).

Note: while this is an acceptable situation for automatic topology build, it can constitute an error in the data: if, in reality, (d) is connected to (a), (b) and (c) it should be moved to within the tolerance distance from all three link ends and the node.

*Figure 43 â€“ Acceptable and unacceptable positioning of link ends and nodes.*

=== Linear Referencing

Linear referencing as defined in the ISO 19148:2012 will be adopted and aligned with the GNM (and hence this data specification) with after it reaches DIS status, The adoption in the _Transport networks_ data specification is limited to a simple model at this stage.

In general it is expected that linear referencing will be used to model the relationships of objects that are associated with an network, but where the position of those associated objects is not known (or required) to a very high level of absolute accuracy ~ better than 1-3m at local level (e.g. traffic accidents, planned works, restrictions).

The position of centrelines and nodes in a network in many cases will vary from the "true position" (since the centreline is rarely that and the node is not a tangible physical feature or location (see 10.1 above).

Where absolute accuracy is required (e.g. the location of drain covers, excavations, line side signalling equipment, masts etc) such objects should be reused, and referenced, if they already exist e.g. as topographic features.

=== Alternative and Multiple Representations

Alternative and multiple representations are discussed further in Annex B.1.

_Alternative Representations_

Where centreline and topographic area objects coexist it is important that users holding information on one of these forms can share information with another e.g. details of a planned excavation at the topographic level with the corresponding centreline representation to plan diversions during the time of the works. It is important therefore that these alternative representations are well synchronised and follow the requirement in 10.1. Cross referencing them will support easy and unambiguous data exchange and support synchronised maintenance (see Annex B.1) â€“ which ever organisation is responsible for the alternative forms.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 44*

Alternative representations should be cross referenced to support data sharing and synchronised maintenance.

====

_Multiple Representations_

In this sense the different resolutions may extend from the local to European level in a number of steps (levels of detail). An ideal model is described in D2.6 A.19 but has yet to be fully developed and realised.

At the moment transforming existing vector datasets, at different levels of detail, beyond the local level to this data specification will not necessarily result in a set of harmonised transport networks for each of the themes _Road, Rail, Water_ (this will be dependent on the _Hydrography_ specification) and _Air_ (where there are probably fewer levels of detail).

Nevertheless as a step towards a more harmonised model users should aim to collect their own application data and hold that once and reference it to each corresponding level of detail (rather than embed the application data in the local or intermediate level). This will promote reuse, easier data sharing and make national and European reporting (through aggregation) easier.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 45*

As a step towards a more harmonised set of levels of detail, users should hold their application data once and simply reference this to each level of detail in a network.

== Portrayal

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for this theme. Portrayal is regulated in Article 14 of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

. For the portrayal of spatial data sets using a view network service as specified in Commission Regulation No 976/2009 (footnote:[OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9.]), the following shall be available:
[loweralpha]
.. the layers specified in Annex II for the theme or themes the data set is related to;
.. for each layer at least a default portrayal style, with as a minimum an associated title and a unique identifier.

[arabic, start=2]
. For each layer, Annex II defines the following:
[loweralpha]
.. a human readable title of the layer to be used for display in user interface;
.. the spatial object type(s), or sub-set thereof, that constitute(s) the content of the layer.

====

In section 0, the _types_ of layers are defined that are to be used for the portrayal of the spatial object types defined in this specification. A view service may offer several layers of the same type, one for each dataset that it offers data on a specific topic.

NOTE The layer specification in the IRs only contains the name, a human readable title and the (subset(s) of) spatial object type(s), that constitute(s) the content of the layer. In addition, these Technical Guidelines suggest keywords for describing the layer.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 46*

It is recommended to use the keywords specified in section 0 in the _Layers Metadata parameters_ of the INSPIRE View service (see Annex III, Part A, section 2.2.4 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009).

====

Section 11.2 specifies one style for each of these layers. It is proposed that INSPIRE view services support this style as the default style required by Article 14(1b).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 7*

For each layer specified in this section, the styles defined in section 11.2 shall be available.

====

NOTE The default style should be used for portrayal by the view network service if no user-defined style is specified in a portrayal request for a specific layer.

In section 11.1.1, further styles can be specified that represent examples of styles typically used in a thematic domain. It is recommended that also these styles should be supported by INSPIRE view services, where applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 47*

In addition, it is recommended that, where applicable, INSPIRE view services also support the styles defined in section 11.1.

====

Where XML fragments are used in the following sections, the following namespace prefixes apply:

[appendix]
== Abstract Test Suite - (normative)

[cols=""]
|===
*Disclaimer*

While this Annex refers to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services, it does not replace the legal act or any part of it.
|===

The objective of the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) included in this Annex is to help the conformance testing process. It includes a set of tests to be applied on a data set to evaluate whether it fulfils the requirements included in this data specification and the corresponding parts of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010 (implementing rule as regards interoperability of spatial datasets and services, further referred to as ISDSS Regulation). This is to help data providers in declaring the conformity of a data set to the "degree of conformity, with implementing rules adopted under Article 7(1) of Directive 2007/2/EC", which is required to be provided in the data set metadata according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2008/1205 (the Metadata Regulation).

*Part 1* of this ATS includes tests that provide *input for assessing conformity with the ISDSS regulation.* In order to make visible which requirements are addressed by a specific test, references to the corresponding articles of the legal act are given. The way how the cited requirements apply to tn specification is described under the testing method.

In addition to the requirements included in ISDSS Regulation this Technical guideline contains TG requirements too. TG requirements are technical provisions that need to be fulfilled in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement when the specific technical implementation proposed in this document is used. Such requirements relate for example to the default encoding described in section 9. *Part 2* of the ATS presents tests necessary for assessing the *conformity with TG requirements*.

NOTE Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in this ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

The *ATS is applicable to the data sets that* *have been transformed* to be made available through INSPIRE download services (i.e. the data returned as a response to the mandatory "Get Spatial Dataset" operation) rather than the original "source" data sets.

The requirements to be tested are grouped in several _conformance classes_. Each of these classes covers a specific aspect: one conformance class contains tests reflecting the requirements on the application schema, another on the reference systems, etc. *Each conformance class is identified by a URI* (uniform resource identifier) according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/tn/<conformance class identifier>

EXAMPLE 1 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ef/rs_ identifies the Reference Systems ISDSS conformance class of the Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF) data theme.

The results of the tests should be published referring to the relevant conformance class (using its URI).

When an INSPIRE data specification contains *more than one application schema,* the requirements tested in a conformance class may differ depending on the application schema used as a target for the transformation of the data set. This will always be the case for the application schema conformance class. However, also other conformance classes could have different requirements for different application schemas. In such cases, a separate conformance class is defined for each application schema, and they are distinguished by specific URIs according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/tn/<conformance class identifier>/<application schema namespace prefix>

EXAMPLE 2 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/el/as/el-vec_ identifies the conformity with the application schema (_as_) conformance class for the Elevation Vector Elements (_el-vec_) application schema.

An overview of the conformance classes and the associated tests is given in the table below.

In order to be conformant to a conformance class, a data set has to pass *all* tests defined for that conformance class.

In order to be conformant with the ISDSS regulation the inspected data set needs to be conformant to *all* conformance classes in Part 1. The conformance class for overall conformity with the ISDSS regulation is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/tn/._

In order to be conformant with the Technical Guidelines, the dataset under inspection needs to be conformant to all conformance classes included both in Part 1 and 2. Chapter 8 describes in detail how to publish the result of testing regarding overall conformity and conformity with the conformance classes as metadata. The conformance class for overall conformity with the Technical Guidelines is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/tg/tn/3.2._

It should be noted that data providers are not obliged to integrate / decompose the original structure of the source data sets when they deliver them for INSPIRE. It means that a conformant dataset can contain less or more spatial object / data types than specified in the ISDSS Regulation.

*A dataset that contains less spatial object and/or data types* can be regarded conformant when the corresponding types of the source datasets after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation.

A *dataset that contain more spatial object and/or data types* may be regarded as conformant when

* all the spatial object / data types that have corresponding types in the source dataset after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation and
* all additional elements of the source model (spatial object types, data types, attributes, constraints, code lists and enumerations together with their values) do not conflict with any rule defined in the interoperability target specifications defined for any theme within INSPIRE.

[.red.background]
====
*Opens issue 2:* Even though the last condition can be derived from Art. 8(4) of the Directive, the ISDSS Regulation does not contain requirements concerning the above issue. Therefore, no specific tests have been included in this abstract suite for testing conformity of extended application schemas. Annex F of the Generic Conceptual Model (D2.5) provides an example how to extend INSPIRE application schemas in a compliant way.

====

The ATS contains a detailed list of abstract tests. It should be noted that some tests in the Application schema conformance class can be automated by utilising xml *schema validation tools.* It should be noted that failing such validation test does not necessary reflect non-compliance to the application schema; it may be the results of erroneous encoding.

Each test in this suite follows the same structure:

* Requirement: citation from the legal texts (ISDSS requirements) or the Technical Guidelines (TG requirements);
* Purpose: definition of the scope of the test;
* Reference: link to any material that may be useful during the test;
* Test method: description of the testing procedure.

According to ISO 19105:2000 all tests in this ATS are basic tests. Therefore, this statement is not repeated each time.

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Inspect whether provided XML schema is conformant to the encoding specified in ISO 19139 for each metadata instance.

NOTE 1 Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

==== Metadata occurrence test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether the occurrence of each metadata element corresponds to those specified in section 8.

. [.underline]#Reference#: Section 8 of this technical guideline

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine the number of occurrences for each metadata element. The number of occurrences shall be compared with its occurrence specified in Section 8:

NOTE 1 Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schema

==== Metadata consistency test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether the metadata elements follow the path specified in ISO/TS 19139.

. [.underline]#Reference#: Section 8 of this technical guideline, ISO/TS 19139

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Compare the XML schema of each metadata element with the path provide in ISO/TS 19137.

NOTE 1 This test does not apply to the metadata elements that are not included in ISO/TS 19139.

==== Encoding schema validation test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether the provided dataset follows the rules of default encoding specified in section 9 of this document

. [.underline]#Reference#: section 9 of this technical guideline

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Inspect whether provided encoding(s) is conformant to the encoding(s) for the relevant application schema(s) as defined in section 9:

NOTE 1 Applying this test to the default encoding schema described in section 9 facilitates testing conformity with the application schema specified in section 5. In such cases running this test with positive result may replace tests from A1.1 to A1.4 provided in this abstract test suite.

NOTE 2 Using Schematron or other schema validation tool may significantly improve the validation process, because some some complex constraints of the schema cannot be validated using the simple XSD validation process. On the contrary to XSDs Schematron rules are not delivered together with the INSPIRE data specifications. Automating the process of validation (e.g. creation of Schematron rules) is therefore a task and an opportunity for data providers.

==== Coverage multipart representation test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether coverage data encoded as multipart messages comply with the multipart representation conformance class defined in GML Application Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2].

. [.underline]#Reference#: OGC standard GML Application Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2].

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Inspect whether coverage data encoded as multipart messages comply with the multipart representation conformance class defined in GML Application Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2].

NOTE further information is provided in section 9.4 of this technical guideline.

==== Coverage domain consistency test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether the encoded coverage domain is consistent with the information provided in the GML application schema.

. [.underline]#Reference#: Section 9.4.1.2 of this technical guideline.

. [.underline]#Test Method#: For multipart coverage messages compare the encoded coverage domain with the description of the coverage component in the GML application schema

NOTE 1 This test applies only to those multipart messages, where the coverage range is encoded together with the coverage domain (some binary formats).

NOTE 2 .This test does not apply to multipart messages where the coverage range is embedded without describing the data structure (e.g. text based formats).

==== Style test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether the styles defined in section 11.2 have been made available for each specified layer.

. [.underline]#Reference#: section 11.2.

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Check whether the styles defined in section 11.2 have been made available for each specified layer.

|Priority |High
|Description a|
*This Use Case*

_This use case provides a very high level summary to support the development of the INSPIRE Transport Networks Data Specification._

_From the INSPIRE Directive:_

"7. Transport networks

Road, rail, air and water transport networks and related infrastructure. Includes links between different networks. Also includes the trans-European transport network as defined in Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community Guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (1) and future revisions of that Decision.

(1) OJ L 228, 9.9.1996, p. 1. Decision as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1791/2006 (OJ L 363, 20.12.2006, p. 1)."

L228 (*Ref A*) was updated in 2004 and that update is referred to in this document as Ref B. 1791/2006 (Ref C) introduces new member states but has less impact on the types of objects and how these might be used as part of an integrated transport network in Europe

The use case is based on the section on pre-conditions below â€“ ie that an Environmental Impact Assessment will be performed on any new transport development.

The data sources section below outlines the transport network information/objects that are required as part of the transport network.

The Flow of Events section outlines some of the activities that might be executed using the transport network information (and possibly 3^rd^ party information as well) to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment based on Ref D.

=== Speed advice

[%autowidth,options="header"]
|===
2+|Use Case Description
|Name |Speed advice
|Priority |Medium
|Description |Demonstration of on-trip information and warning services on current speed limits on the road
|Pre-condition a|
The EU project EuroRoadS has, based on requirements being described in the EU project Speed Alert, created a speed limit information model, which includes a number of characteristics of importance for giving a driver advice on highest recommended speed on a road segment. The model includes

* differentiation of minimum/maximum speed limit
* lane reference
* validity period
* area condition
* source of information
* vehicle dependency

2+h|*Flow of Events â€“ Basic Path*
|Step 1 |The draft Inspire specification for Transport networks is compared with the EuroRoadS framework of specifications in order to find out if the specification gives the right level of detail for speed advice services
|Step 2 |After the theoretical study in step 1 a practical test might be carried out following the demonstration that was carried out within EuroRoadS. This requires contribution from the organisations who took part in this work.
2+h|*Flow of Events â€“ Alternative Paths*
|Step 1 a|
[upperalpha]
. Review and comparison of the two specifications
. Report on findings

|Step 2 a|
[upperalpha]
. Agreement on demonstration area and participants for a more practical demonstration
. Establishment of work flow for demonstration
. Loading of test data according to the specification
. Practical tests
. Report on findings

|Post-condition |Show the benefits from the specification for an application being of interest for political reasons (road safety, environmental protection, etc) as well as for private industry developments (speed advice device).

== Supplementary Information regarding alternative representations of network objects - (informative)

=== Alternative Representations

This section describes the three main forms of road, rail and water transport network representation. The model supports Physical (topographic) and centreline representations.

image::./media/image71.png[image,width=217,height=231, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure C1-1. Alternative transport network Representations*

In the above Figure B1-1 the road is represented in three forms:

[loweralpha]
. *Physical (topographic) extents.* The lines shown in red above (ie edges of area objects) normally represent the extent of the surface of the highway, (or banks of the river at a given time of year e.g. winter water level). The area is normally segmented into several sub units (not shown on this sketch) where their aggregation will define the full extent of the road or river. Narrow sections will often be represented by a single line.
+
This network can only be inferred since there is no knowledge of which objects connect in any ordered sequence or state (though this could be achieved if required â€“ it is not covered on this version of the specification. Similar approaches are applicable to road, air and some aspects of cable and rail networks.

. *Centreline model* â€“ (the green dashed line above) is a set of (or aggregation of) lines that represent the centre of the physical object e.g. a road or river â€“ this usually the approximate centre (sometimes known as a reference line instead because of this). Nodes (red disks) are also shown in the figure above.
+
Generally this approach will support topology and specific forms of network analysis. Therefore the sequence and relationships between the lines is understood and in some cases ordered. Nodes may be implied or explicit. All spatial objects will be described by coordinates.
+
Centrelines are often linked to the underlying physical (topographic) extents â€“ see Figure B1-2 below.

image::./media/image72.png[image,width=388,height=291, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure C1-2: Linking centrelines and physical (topographic) extents*


[loweralpha, start=3]
. *Logical model* â€“ (the blue dashed line in Figure B1-1 above) is a set of lines linking all the nodes of the network (chosen to be junctions & ends). The spatial content is therefore limited or non-existent (spatial coordinates of the nodes are not always included) and the logical model has limited value to a _spatial_ data infrastructure but it is used in some transport operations. The approach can be modelled in this specification by simply inserting a single link between nodes.
. *Aligning Logical and Centreline Models:* users may if they wish align a logical model with the centreline/physical models to share information between them within a set of applications. This can be achieved by relating (e.g. cross referencing all those nodes that are common in each system). The logical model can then inherit the spatial location of the centreline nodes which will provide a level of spatial positioning and interoperability.
