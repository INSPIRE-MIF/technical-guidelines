== How to read the document?

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Production and Industrial Facilities â€“ Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.0 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _Production and Industrial Facilities_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Production and Industrial Facilities_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Production and Industrial Facilities_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services â€“ General Executive Summary

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services,] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML â€“ Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== _Production and Industrial Facilities_ â€“ Executive Summary

INSPIRE Directive (2007/2/EC, 14.03.2007) defines the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ as: "features related to production and industry, as well as entities related to describing summary information about the activities taking place in production and industrial facilities, and the main environmental issues related to them (pollution prevention, waste management, risk)".

This version of the data specification on _Production and Industrial Facilities_ provides:

* The basis for the development of the part of the Implementing Rules, defined in the Article 7(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, related to the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ and;
* The implementation guidelines that will accompany the Implementing Rule on the Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services according to Article 7(1) of the INSPIRE Directive.

The data specification has been prepared by the INSPIRE Thematic Working Group _Production and Industrial Facilities_ (TWG-PF), a multinational team of experts in the field drawn from different parts of the European Union, in the frame of the common and transparent development process.

This version of the INSPIRE data specification for _Production and Industrial Facilities_ has been compiled from reference material submitted by the Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDICs) and Legally Mandated Organisation (LMOs) of INSPIRE, plus the responses to the User Requirements Survey and a set of agreed use cases - some of which have been specifically prepared by the TWG-PF based on their knowledge and experience.

[.underline]#*Scope and description*#

There are relationships with other spatial data themes, in particular with:

* Agricultural Facilities
* Utilities and Governmental Services
* Buildings
* Addresses
* Administrative Units
* Cadastral Parcels

Details on these relationships will be provided in Chapter 5, Data content and structure.

The PF data specification accounts for in-depth harmonisation with the two other themes involving facilities, i.e. Agricultural Facilities and Utilities and Governmental Services, with the adoption of a common facility model (so called Activity Complex), described in the document "DS 2.10.3 â€“ Activity Complex".

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ as defined in Annex III of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

== Overview

=== Name
INSPIRE data specification for the theme _Production and     Industrial Facilities_.
    

=== Informal description

[.underline]#*Definition:*#

This theme comprises features related to production and industry, as well as entities related to describing summary information about the activities taking place in _Production and Industrial Facilities_, and the main environmental issues related to them (pollution prevention, waste management, risk). [Directive 2007/2/EC]

[.underline]#*Description:*#

The overall set of activities considered within the _Production and Industrial Facilities_ theme spans from extraction of resources, to their transformation in products or by-products, and their storage.

* [.underline]#Extraction of resources# includes the following: non-energy extractive industry (mining of construction materials, industrial minerals, and metallic minerals), energy extractive industry, and water.
* [.underline]#Transformation of resources# should be seen both as transformation of one resource or product into another, or as transformation into energy, thus including power generation plants within the scope of this theme.
* [.underline]#Storage# includes structures for warehousing, depositing in safe custody, or keeping in stock any substance involved in the production process. Considering also waste as a component of the production process, landfills and other facilities for permanent or temporary waste storage are also to be included within the scope of this theme.

Large installations for communication (communication stations) are considered within the scope of this theme.

The definition of the types of industrial activities to be considered can be related primarily to Annex I of the IPPC Directive [Directive 2008/1/EC] and the E-PRTR Regulation [Regulation 166/2006/EC]. Important references used in the definition of the data specification are also found in the SEVESO Directive and its amendments [Directive 96/82/EC-A].

The NACE rev. 2 classification [Regulation 1893/2006/EC] is also considered in the definition of the activities. Activities considered for _Production and Industrial Facilities_ fall under the first-level NACE rev. 2 categories B, C, D, E, F and H. This translates to considering:

* mining and quarrying,
* manufacturing,
* electricity,
* gas,
* steam and air conditioning supply,
* water supply;
* construction,
* Transport and storage (excluding postal and courier activities).

Another more recent directive which allows describing in a comprehensive way _Production and Industrial Facilities_ is the Directive on Industrial Emissions [Directive 2010/75/EU]. Annex I of this Directive lists the types of production considered in its scope and may be used as a reference to identify industrial activities.

_Production and Industrial Facilities_ are also related to an operator, i.e. the natural or legal person who operates or controls the facility or, where this is provided in national legislation, to which decisive economic power over the technical functioning of the facility has been delegated.

The _Production and Industrial Facilities_ theme is not concerned with the description of the actual flow of materials occurring from one facility to another, or to distribution of a final product to the market.

A production and industrial facility is typically composed by an extremely variable layout of buildings, plots and other technical units, represented by machinery, piping, private railway sidings, docks, unloading quays, jetties, etc. Such units are grouped in installations, related to the execution of a specific production process.

Key feature types with spatial properties considered within the _Production and Industrial Facilities_ theme include: Site, Facility, Installation and Installation Part. These allow a breakdown of the elements composing a production and industrial facility, with a focus on processes related to activities taking place within the facility itself.

Two accessory spatial feature types have been considered: Production and Industrial Building and Production Plot.

* A [.underline]#Production Plot# is a piece of land part of a facility destined to functional purposes (even though no "artifacts" are in it). This may be required for examples for temporary storage inside the facility.
* A [.underline]#Production and industrial building# is an artificial construction, part of the production facility that is useful to host or provide shelter to activity development.

Concerning spatial aspects, the minimum level of detail for spatial representation provides the request of capturing facilities as point features, while point features such as installations and installation parts allow a more accurate description, in cases where such level of detail is available. Moreover a facility may present a higher level of detail representation on a map if its areal shape is provided; the same occurs for the site and for the installation and the parcel and the building.

Concerning temporal aspects, a production facility is seen as such as long as the activity hosted by it is ongoing. Should this activity terminate, the facility may maintain an industrial characterisation from an environmental standpoint (such as the case of a contaminated site). Numerous cases of more or less historical facilities which have been converted to interesting historical landmarks, or to cultural and educational/recreational venues may also be observed. These facilities, while retaining the layout and construction characteristics of a production/industrial site, will lose their industrial status, and should be typically reclassified as Buildings, Governmental Services. The data model accounts for the possibility of tracking the status of the facility and the other spatial objects with the use of temporal properties indicating the time period during which the status of the spatial object is active falls into another of the possible categories (the code list on status described in Chapter 5 provides a full list for these).

As an extension to the core model, this data specification also provides a basic model to describe production and industrial processes, as well as operators and addresses. The production process extension allows recording information on quantities of materials and substances which are reaching a facility, which are stored on it, or which are leaving it, in order to describe its state. However, it is not within the scope of the theme to track where a given stock of material is coming from, or where it is going to.

The operators and addresses extension allows capturing business-related information such as the identity of the subjects related to a facility, and can hold information on addresses.

This theme comprises features related to production and industry, as well as entities related to describing summary information about the activities taking place in _Production and Industrial Facilities_, and the main environmental issues related to them (pollution prevention, waste management, risk). [Directive 2007/2/EC]

[.underline]#*Description:*#    

The theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ comprises information about industrial facilities and activities of production (focusing on extraction, transformation or storage of resources, including energy production) and the main related environmental issues.

The description of production and industrial facilities, e.g. types or activities, in INSPIRE is based on the Integrated pollution prevention and control Directive (2008/1/EC), as recently amended by Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU), the European pollution and transfer register regulation (166/2006/EC), the SEVESO Directive, its amendments (96/82/EC-A), the NACE regulation (1893/2006/EC) and other relevant legislation and industrial standards.

=== How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 1 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

*Figure 1 - Relationship between INSPIRE Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines*

==== Requirements

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Production and Industrial Facilities_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X* 

This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.

====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X* 

Recommendations are shown using this style.

====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

*IR Requirement*
_Article 4_
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ are defined in the following application schemas (see sections 5.3):

* _Production and Industrial Facilities_ application schema.

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

NOTE The application schemas presented in this section contain some additional information that is not included in the Implementing Rules, in particular multiplicities of attributes and association roles.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 1*

Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the multiplicities defined for the attributes and association roles in this section.

====

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

==== Additional recommended application schemas 

In addition to the application schemas listed above, the following additional application schemas have been defined for the theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ (see sections 5.4):

* _Production and Industrial Facilities Extension_ application schema.

These additional application schemas are not included in the IRs. They typically address requirements from specific (groups of) use cases and/or may be used to provide additional information. They are included in this specification in order to improve interoperability also for these additional aspects and to illustrate the extensibility of the application schemas included in the IRs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

Additional and/or use case-specific information related to the theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ should be made available using the spatial object types and data types specified in the following application schema(s): _Production and Industrial Facilities Extension_.

These spatial object types and data types should comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles defined in this section.

The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types should comply with the definitions and include the values defined in this section.

====

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema â€“ across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 5_
*Types*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.

. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 1 below.

[.text-center]
*Table 1 â€“ Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided â€“ either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 2*

The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the Â«voidableÂ» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the Â«voidableÂ» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=5]
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*


. Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:
[loweralpha]
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;
.. code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 3*

Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.

. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 4*

Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows.
+
INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>/<value>.


* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined.
+
Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists.
+
The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:

** The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.

** The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".

** In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.

** The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones.

+
Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.


[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 5*

The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<UpperCamelCaseName>_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "{complete,disjoint}".

==== Identifier management

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.

. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

====

NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier which is published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. [DS-D2.5]

NOTE 2 Article 9(1) is implemented in each application schema by including the attribute _inspireId_ of type Identifier.

NOTE 3 Article 9(2) is ensured if the _namespace_ and _localId_ attributes of the Identifier remains the same for different versions of a spatial object; the _version_ attribute can of course change.

==== Geometry representation

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_
*Other Requirements & Rules*

. The value domain of spatial properties defined in this Regulation shall be restricted to the Simple Feature spatial schema as defined in Herring, John R. (ed.), OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information â€“ Simple feature access â€“ Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

[IMPORTANT]

*IR Requirement*
_Article 10_
*Life-cycle of Spatial Objects*

NOTE The requirement expressed in the IR Requirement above will be included as constraints in the UML data models of all themes.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 6*

If life-cycle information is not maintained as part of the spatial data set, all spatial objects belonging to this data set should provide a void value with a reason of "unpopulated".

====

===== Validity of the real-world phenomena

The application schema(s) use(s) the attributes "validFrom" and "validTo" to record the validity of the real-world phenomenon represented by a spatial object.

The attributes "validFrom" specifies the date and time at which the real-world phenomenon became valid in the real world. The attribute "validTo" specifies the date and time at which the real-world phenomenon is no longer valid in the real world.

Specific application schemas may give examples what "being valid" means for a specific real-world phenomenon represented by a spatial object.

=== Application schema Production and Industrial Facilities 

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The application schema for _Production and Industrial Facilities_ provides the common pan-European information related with the acknowledgment of all Facilities under the scope of Production and Industrial classification, moreover focussing on the key feature types corresponding to the spatial objects in the Production and Industrial (PF) context.

The overall schema takes into account three information frames as technical points of view respondent to distinct class diagrams, harmonised parts of a unique data model, called: Production Framework, Production Unit and Cross Theme Relationships.

The Production Framework view maps the core of the PF data model, focusing on the key feature types corresponding to the spatial objects in the PF context: Production Facility, Production Installation, Production Installation Part, and Production Site.

The Production Facility feature type is the model's main pivot to represent _Production and Industrial Facilities_ spatial entities. It is the only spatial object type within the PF Theme requested to provide a mandated geometry property as point location. The complementary geometry property is the surface, mapping the extension location for the Facility.

A Facility represents something designed, built, installed to serve a specific function, comprehending the complete equipment or apparatus for a particular process or operation. A facility groups together one or more installations that are operated on the same site by the same natural or legal person and, where present, the land, buildings, and equipment used in carrying on an industrial, business, or other undertaking or service.

Based on the description provided by the legislation, hierarchically below a Facility there are Installations. The spatial object type may declare a geometry property as point location. The alternative or complementary geometry property is the surface, mapping the extension location for the Installation.

A Production Installation represents something installed, such as machinery, an apparatus, a device, a system, or a piece of equipment placed in position or connected for use. It is the stationary technical unit part of a facility where one or more activities are carried out, and any other directly associated activities which have a technical connection to the activities carried out on that site and which could have an effect on emissions and pollution are found. An installation may be a technical unit within an establishment in which dangerous substances are produced, used, handled or stored.

The lowest level of entities in the model is the Installation Part. The spatial object type may declare a geometry property as point location. The alternative or complementary geometry property is the surface, mapping the extension location for the Installation Part.

A Production Installation Part represents a specific technical part of the installation, developing a representative functionality that should be registered under the legislation. Installation parts are considered in the core application schema, since the explicit location of several of these features is required by legislation. An example in this respect is represented by chimneys, for which the explicit location is required in permitting applications. Another example is given by storage tanks for hazardous substances, which need to be identified as sources of major accident risks under the SEVESO directive.

A Production Site represents the geographical location of the facility or a piece of land where the facility was, is, or is intended to be located. Activities under the control of an organization may be carried out on it. The location should be provided with defined geographical boundaries, thus the spatial object type may declare a geometry property as surface, mapping the extension location for the Site. The geographical boundaries may be on land and in water, and include above and below surface structures, both natural and man-made.

Subsidiary spatial objects in the PF context and potentially grouped by a Facility are Production Building and Production Plot.

* A Production Building represents an artificial construction, part of the production facility, required to host or to provide shelter to activity development. Inside a facility, and in relation with the definition of building, this entity should represent a construction under responsibility of the facility, either as an independent unit or as a functional infrastructure for an installation. It should be considered from the functional perspective. This entity is very closely related with a similar entity under the scope of the Buildings Theme, from which it is related: a Production Building can be linked with an _AbstractBuilding_, which is a special kind of Abstract Building (please refer to the Buildings Theme for a more in-depth description). This extension allows complement the definition of entities with physical / architectonical information.
* A Production Plot represents a piece of land part of a facility serving a functional purpose within the facility. It is a potential sub-division of a major site as delimited extension of land in which extensive operations related with the activity or one of the activities managed by a facility are performed. The spatial object type may declare a geometry property as surface, mapping the extension location for the Plot.

The Cross Theme Relationships view maps and summarises all the key links recognised between the application schema for _Production and Industrial Facilities_ and other INSPIRE Themes. Most relevant is Production Facility as a special kind of Activity Complex.

While spatial object referencing is potentially allowed between any spatial object types from the PF Theme with any other spatial object from other INSPIRE Themes, the Cross Theme Relationship view intends to expose the links which have been recognised as the most important ones in relation to the use cases and to the other material considered in the specification definition. The most frequently used spatial object referencing cases involve the PF core element, the Production Facility, and the Administrative Unit (Administrative Units Theme), the Cadastral Parcel (Cadastral Parcels Theme), the Existing Land Use Object (Land Use Theme), the Management Regulation Or Restriction Zone (Area Management/Restriction/Regulation Zones And Reporting Units Theme).

The present view recalls also the relationship of the Production Facility with the common level of the Facility data Model, through the dependence of the Production Facility from the Activity Complex.

The data model overview is completed by accessory application schema views showing the Data Types, the Code Lists and Enumerations.

The _Imported Types_ view corresponds to the UML class diagram with the following natural language description:

* The Identifier data type was imported from the Generic Conceptual Model.
* The ActivityComplex feature type was imported from the Generic Conceptual Model â€“ Base Models â€“ Activity Complex.

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

_Production and Industrial Facilities_ data are in very close relation with data coming from other INSPIRE Themes, such as Agricultural and Aquaculture Facilities, Mineral Resources or Energy Resources among others.

Furthermore, the part of Utility and Governmental Services related with Waste treatment and the Utility Network also has a significant relationship with _Production and Industrial Facilities_.

The main links among all these groups are implemented within the INSPIRE data model by sharing the Facility and Activity concepts across these themes. This harmonisation effort is represented by the definition of a common class for facilities, named ActivityComplex, from which the key ProductionFacility class was specialized.

===== Identifier management

Identifiers are provided for key entities: the _inspireId_ is provided for all PF spatial object types and the _thematicId_ is provided for object types where an alternative unique identification is requested, in presence or not of the _inspireId_. The definition of these two identifiers can be found in the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model guidelines (D2.5).

===== Modelling of object references

Identifiers are provided for key entities: the _inspireId_ is provided for all PF spatial object types and the ThematicId is provided for object types where an alternative unique identification is requested, in presence or not of the inspireId. The definition of these two identifiers can be found in the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model guidelines (D2.5).

=== Application schema Production and Industrial Facilities Extension

==== Description

===== Narrative description

The application schema for _Production and Industrial Facilities_ Extension provides the subsidiary common pan-European information related with Facilities under the scope of the Production and Industrial context, following the Community legislation and apart the spatial aspects. The present application schema shall be considered as integration for the application schema for _Production and Industrial Facilities_: this means that only additional elements, in respect of the basic ones included in clause 5.2, will be documented here.

The extended model is based on Technical Units which represent an abstract class (extensible by Production Facility, Production Installation or Production Installation Part) with the capacity of performing Activities as those described listed in the Eurostat NACE classification established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament.

The Production Process view maps the Activities performed by the Technical Unit, and the related Production Process.

In the production context, an Activity represents the individual or organised set of processes for the production of consumer goods (or by-products required by other production or industrial activities). In this case processing typically describes the act of taking some substance or material through an established and usually routine set of procedures to convert it from one form to another, such as a manufacturing. One or more activities may be performed in the Technical Unit, covering the facility or smaller unit of the facility (i.e. an installation or an installation part). The Production Process is information mapped on the couple of a certain Activity associated with a specific Technical Unit. Formally a Production Process is consisting of a series of actions or operations in a productive context: in this sense a Production Process is a procedure grouping a sequence of phases or steps, considering that all the sequence has to be initiated from Process Input and to result in Process Output. The latter aspect is the main information we are interested in.

The Process Input for a certain Process is represented in a simplified way by any kind of substance (material), energy, waste, product entering a production cycle.

The Process Output is represented by any kind of substance, energy, waste, product or emission originating from a production cycle. More precisely an Emission is a special kind of Process Output.

The data model overview is completed by accessory application schema views showing the Data Types, the Code Lists and Enumerations, and the Imported Types (from other INSPIRE Themes).

*Figure 8 â€“ UML class diagram: Overview of the ProductionAndIndustrialFacilitiesExtension application schema â€“ Technical Units View*

The _Technical Units_ view corresponds to the UML class diagram with the following natural language description:

* A Technical Units with is an abstract class extensible to Production Facility, Production Installation and Production Installation Part. Technical Units can be considered as a Node on the context of a Utility Network.
* A ProductionFacilityExtended as extension of Production Facility with is an extension of the abstract class Technical Unit.
* A ProductionInstallationExtended as extension of Production Installation with is an extension of the abstract class Technical Unit.
* A ProductionInstallationPartExtended as extension of Production Installation Part with is an extension of the abstract class Technical Unit.

[.text-center]
*Figure 9 - UML class diagram: Overview of the ProductionAndIndustrialFacilitiesExtension application schema â€“ Production Process view*

The _Production Process_ view corresponds to the UML class diagram with the following natural language description:

A TechnicalUnit attends to one to many Activities. An Activity may be performed by one or more TechnicalUnits, this means an Activity may be shared by different TechnicalUnits.

A ProductionProcess is associated to the couple "TechnicalUnit â€“ Activity", this means each couple "TechnicalUnit â€“ Activity" may characterise its own ProductionProcess, with information on specific ProcessInput and ProcessOutput items.

A ProcessInput feeds a ProductionProcess. Vice versa, a ProductionProcess may receive one or more ProcessInput items. Substance, energy, waste, product are different kinds of ProcessInput items.

A ProcessOutput item derives from a ProductionProcess. Vice versa, a ProductionProcess may release one or more ProcessOutput items. Substance, energy, waste, product, are different kinds of ProcessOutput items. Emission is a special kind of ProcessOutput item.

* The CPACodeValue code list hosts the family of reference values for the "product" item referred to the attribute processItem in the ProcessInput or ProcessOutput classes. A product means something that is produced, result of manufacturing, a result of an action or a process.
* The CLPCodeValue code list hosts the family of reference values for the "substance" item referred to the attribute processItem in the ProcessInput or ProcessOutput classes and to the attribute pollutantSubstance in the Emission class. Substance means any chemical element and its compounds, with the exception of some specific substances.
* The EWCCodeValue code list hosts the family of reference values for the "waste" item referred to the attribute processItem in the ProcessInput or ProcessOutput classes. Waste means any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.

== Reference systems, units of measure and grids

=== Default reference systems, units of measure and grid

The reference systems, units of measure and geographic grid systems included in this sub-section are the defaults to be used for all INSPIRE data sets, unless theme-specific exceptions and/or additional requirements are defined in section 6.2.

==== Coordinate reference systems

===== Datum

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.2_
*Datum for three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems*

For the three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems and the horizontal component of compound coordinate reference systems used for making spatial data sets available, the datum shall be the datum of the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) in areas within its geographical scope, or the datum of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) or other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with ITRS in areas that are outside the geographical scope of ETRS89. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of the ITRS and there is a well documented relationship between both systems, according to EN ISO 19111.

====

===== Coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.3_
*Coordinate Reference Systems*

Spatial data sets shall be made available using at least one of the coordinate reference systems specified in sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, unless one of the conditions specified in section 1.3.4 holds.

*1.3.1. Three-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.

* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

*1.3.2. Two-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate reference system.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Transverse Mercator coordinate reference system.


*1.3.3. Compound Coordinate Reference Systems*

--
. For the horizontal component of the compound coordinate reference system, one of the coordinate reference systems specified in section 1.3.2 shall be used.

. For the vertical component, one of the following coordinate reference systems shall be used:
--

* For the vertical component on land, the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) shall be used to express gravity-related heights within its geographical scope. Other vertical reference systems related to the Earth gravity field shall be used to express gravity-related heights in areas that are outside the geographical scope of EVRS.

* For the vertical component in the free atmosphere, barometric pressure, converted to height using ISO 2533:1975 International Standard Atmosphere, or other linear or parametric reference systems shall be used. Where other parametric reference systems are used, these shall be described in an accessible reference using EN ISO 19111-2:2012.

* For the vertical component in marine areas where there is an appreciable tidal range (tidal waters), the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) shall be used as the reference surface.

* For the vertical component in marine areas without an appreciable tidal range, in open oceans and effectively in waters that are deeper than 200 meters, the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or a well-defined reference level close to the MSL shall be used as the reference surface.


*1.3.4. Other Coordinate Reference Systems*

Exceptions, where other coordinate reference systems than those listed in 1.3.1, 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 may be used, are:

. Other coordinate reference systems may be specified for specific spatial data themes in this Annex.

. For regions outside of continental Europe, Member States may define suitable coordinate reference systems.

The geodetic codes and parameters needed to describe these coordinate reference systems and to allow conversion and transformation operations shall be documented and an identifier shall be created, according to EN ISO 19111 and ISO 19127.

====

===== Display

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.4_
*Coordinate Reference Systems used in the View Network Service*

For the display of spatial data sets with the view network service as specified in Regulation No 976/2009, at least the coordinate reference systems for two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude) shall be available.

====

===== Identifiers for coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.5_
*Coordinate Reference System Identifiers*

. Coordinate reference system parameters and identifiers shall be managed in one or several common registers for coordinate reference systems.

. Only identifiers contained in a common register shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems listed in this Section.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to use the http URIs provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium as coordinate reference system identifiers (see identifiers for the default CRSs below). These are based on and redirect to the definition in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry (_http://www.epsg-registry.org/_).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 2*

The identifiers listed in Table 2 shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems used in a data set.

====

NOTE CRS identifiers may be used e.g. in:

* data encoding,
* data set and service metadata, and
* requests to INSPIRE network services.

==== Temporal reference system

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 11_
*Temporal Reference Systems*

. The default temporal reference system referred to in point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (footnote:[OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12.]) shall be used, unless other temporal reference systems are specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE 1 Point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (the INSPIRE Metadata IRs) states that the default reference system shall be the Gregorian calendar, with dates expressed in accordance with ISO 8601.

NOTE 2 ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats â€“ Information interchange â€“ Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. The standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears first in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It also provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information across time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

EXAMPLE 1997 (the year 1997), 1997-07-16 (16^th^ July 1997), 1997-07-16T19:20:3001:00 (16^th^ July 1997, 19h 20' 30'', time zone: UTC1)

==== Units of measure

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_
*Other Requirements & Rules*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. All measurement values shall be expressed using SI units or non-SI units accepted for use with the International System of Units, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

=== Theme-specific requirements and recommendations

There are no theme-specific requirements or recommendations on reference systems and grids.

<<<
== Data quality

This chapter includes a description of the data quality elements and sub-elements as well as the corresponding data quality measures that should be used to evaluate and document data quality for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ (section 7.1).

It may also define requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ (sections 7.2).

In particular, the data quality elements, sub-elements and measures specified in section 7.1 should be used for

* evaluating and documenting data quality properties and constraints of spatial objects, where such properties or constraints are defined as part of the application schema(s) (see section 5);

* evaluating and documenting data quality metadata elements of spatial data sets (see section 8); and/or

* specifying requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ (see sections 7.2).


The descriptions of the elements and measures are based on Annex D of ISO/DIS 19157 Geographic information â€“ Data quality.

=== Data quality elements

Table 3 lists all data quality elements and sub-elements that are being used in this specification. Data quality information can be evaluated at level of spatial object, spatial object type, dataset or dataset series. The level at which the evaluation is performed is given in the "Evaluation Scope" column.

The measures to be used for each of the listed data quality sub-elements are defined in the following sub-sections.

|===
|*Name* |*Mean value of positional uncertainties*
|Alternative name |_-_
|Data quality element |Positional Accuracy

|Data quality basic measure |-
|Definition a|
mean value of the positional uncertainties for a set of positions where the

positional uncertainties are defined as the distance between a measured

position and what is considered as the corresponding true position

|Description a|
For a number of points (_N_), the measured positions are given as _x~mi~_, _y~mi~_ and _z~mi~_ coordinates depending on the dimension in which the position of the point is measured. A corresponding set of coordinates, _x~ti~_, _y~ti~_ and _z~ti~_, are considered

to represent the true positions. The errors are calculated as

image::./media/image14.png[image,width=347,height=93, align=center]

The mean positional uncertainties of the horizontal absolute or external positions are then calculated as

image::./media/image15.png[image,width=119,height=82, align=center]

A criterion for the establishing of correspondence should also be stated (e.g. allowing for correspondence to the closest position, correspondence on

vertices or along lines). The criterion/criteria for finding the corresponding

points shall be reported with the data quality evaluation result.

This data quality measure is different from the standard deviation.

== Dataset-level metadata

This section specifies dataset-level metadata elements, which should be used for documenting metadata for a complete dataset or dataset series.

NOTE Metadata can also be reported for each individual spatial object (spatial object-level metadata). Spatial object-level metadata is fully described in the application schema(s) (section 5).

For some dataset-level metadata elements, in particular those for reporting data quality and maintenance, a more specific scope can be specified. This allows the definition of metadata at sub-dataset level, e.g. separately for each spatial object type (see instructions for the relevant metadata element).

=== Metadata elements defined in INSPIRE Metadata Regulation

Table 4 gives an overview of the metadata elements specified in Regulation 1205/2008/EC (implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata).

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to the relevant section in the Metadata Regulation, which contains a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.
* The fourth column specifies the condition, under which the given element becomes mandatory.

Generic guidelines for implementing these elements using ISO 19115 and 19119 are available at _http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101_. The following sections describe additional theme-specific recommendations and requirements for implementing these elements.

==== Conformity

The _Conformity_ metadata element defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC requires to report the conformance with the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services. In addition, it may be used also to document the conformance to another specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 13*

Dataset metadata should include a statement on the overall conformance of the dataset with this data specification (i.e. conformance with all requirements).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 14*

The _Conformity_ metadata element should be used to document conformance with this data specification (as a whole), with a specific conformance class defined in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A and/or with another specification.

====

The _Conformity_ element includes two sub-elements, the _Specification_ (a citation of the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services or other specification), and the _Degree_ of conformity. The _Degree_ can be _Conformant_ (if the dataset is fully conformant with the cited specification), _Not Conformant_ (if the dataset does not conform to the cited specification) or _Not Evaluated_ (if the conformance has not been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 15*

If a dataset is not yet conformant with all requirements of this data specification, it is recommended to include information on the conformance with the individual conformance classes specified in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 16*

If a dataset is produced or transformed according to an external specification that includes specific quality assurance procedures, the conformity with this specification should be documented using the _Conformity_ metadata element.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 17*

If minimum data quality recommendations are defined then the statement on the conformity with these requirements should be included using the _Conformity_ metadata element and referring to the relevant data quality conformance class in the Abstract Test Suite.

====

NOTE Currently no minimum data quality requirements are included in the IRs. The recommendation above should be included as a requirement in the IRs if minimum data quality requirements are defined at some point in the future.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 18*

When documenting conformance with this data specification or one of the conformance classes defined in the Abstract Test Suite, the _Specification_ sub-element should be given using the http URI identifier of the conformance class or using a citation including the following elements:

* title: "INSPIRE Data Specification on _Production and Industrial Facilities_ â€“ Technical Guidelines â€“ <name of the conformance class>"
* date:
** dateType: publication
** date: 2013-12-10

==== Lineage

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 19*

Following the ISO/DIS 19157 Quality principles, if a data provider has a procedure for the quality management of their spatial data sets then the appropriate data quality elements and measures defined in ISO/DIS 19157 should be used to evaluate and report (in the metadata) the results. If not, the _Lineage_ metadata element (defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC) should be used to describe the overall quality of a spatial data set.

====

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, lineage "is a statement on process history and/or overall quality of the spatial data set. Where appropriate it may include a statement whether the data set has been validated or quality assured, whether it is the official version (if multiple versions exist), and whether it has legal validity. The value domain of this metadata element is free text".

The Metadata Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119 specifies that the statement sub-element of LI_Lineage (EN ISO 19115) should be used to implement the lineage metadata element.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 20*

To describe the transformation steps and related source data, it is recommended to use the following sub-elements of LI_Lineage:

* For the description of the transformation process of the local to the common INSPIRE data structures, the LI_ProcessStep sub-element should be used.

* For the description of the source data the LI_Source sub-element should be used.

====

NOTE 1 In order to improve the interoperability, domain templates and instructions for using these free text elements (descriptive statements) may be specified here and/or in an Annex of this data specification.

==== Temporal reference

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, at least one of the following temporal reference metadata sub-elements shall be provided: temporal extent, date of publication, date of last revision, date of creation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 21*

It is recommended that at least the date of the last revision of a spatial data set should be reported using the _Date of last revision_ metadata sub-element.

====

=== Metadata elements for interoperability

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 13_
*Metadata required for Interoperability*

The metadata describing a spatial data set shall include the following metadata elements required for interoperability:

. Coordinate Reference System: Description of the coordinate reference system(s) used in the data set.

. Temporal Reference System: Description of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.

. Encoding: Description of the computer language construct(s) specifying the representation of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device or transmission channel.

. Topological Consistency: Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the data set as described by the scope.
+
This element is mandatory only if the data set includes types from the Generic Network Model and does not assure centreline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for the network.

. Character Encoding: The character encoding used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if an encoding is used that is not based on UTF-8.

. Spatial Representation Type: The method used to spatially represent geographic information.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to implement the required metadata elements based on ISO 19115 and ISO/TS 19139.

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with the proposed encoding.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 3*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the used ISO 19139 XML schema.

====

NOTE Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 4*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall contain the elements and meet the INSPIRE multiplicity specified in the sections below.

====

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 5*

The elements specified below shall be available in the specified ISO/TS 19139 path.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 22*

The metadata elements for interoperability should be made available together with the metadata elements defined in the Metadata Regulation through an INSPIRE discovery service.

====

NOTE While this not explicitly required by any of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, making all metadata of a data set available together and through one service simplifies implementation and usability.

==== Metadata elements for reporting data quality

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 25*

For reporting the results of the data quality evaluation, the data quality elements, sub-elements and (for quantitative evaluation) measures defined in chapter 7 should be used.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 26*

The metadata elements specified in the following sections should be used to report the results of the data quality evaluation. At least the information included in the row "Implementation instructions" should be provided.

====

The first section applies to reporting quantitative results (using the element DQ_QuantitativeResult), while the second section applies to reporting non-quantitative results (using the element DQ_DescriptiveResult).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 27*

If a dataset does not pass the tests of the Application schema conformance class (defined in Annex A), the results of each test should be reported using one of the options described in sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2.

====

NOTE 1 If using non-quantitative description, the results of several tests do not have to be reported separately, but may be combined into one descriptive statement.

NOTE 2 The sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2 may need to be updated once the XML schemas for ISO 19157 have been finalised.

The scope for reporting may be different from the scope for evaluating data quality (see section 7). If data quality is reported at the data set or spatial object type level, the results are usually derived or aggregated.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 28*

The scope element (of type DQ_Scope) of the DQ_DataQuality subtype should be used to encode the reporting scope.

Only the following values should be used for the level element of DQ_Scope: Series, Dataset, featureType.

If the level is featureType the levelDescription/MDScopeDescription/features element (of type Set< GF_FeatureType>) shall be used to list the feature type names.

====

NOTE In the level element of DQ_Scope, the value featureType is used to denote spatial object type.

== Delivery

=== Updates

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 8_
*Updates*

. Member States shall make available updates of data on a regular basis.

. All updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set, unless a different period is specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE In this data specification, no exception is specified, so all updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set.

=== Delivery medium

According to Article 11(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for INSPIRE spatial data sets and services. The relevant network service types for making spatial data available are:

* _view services_ making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;
* _download services_, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;
* _transformation services_, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability.

NOTE For the relevant requirements and recommendations for network services, see the relevant Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelinesfootnote:[The Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines on INSPIRE Network Services are available at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/5].

EXAMPLE 1 Through the Get Spatial Objects function, a download service can either download a pre-defined data set or pre-defined part of a data set (non-direct access download service), or give direct access to the spatial objects contained in the data set, and download selections of spatial objects based upon a query (direct access download service). To execute such a request, some of the following information might be required:

* the list of spatial object types and/or predefined data sets that are offered by the download service (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation),
* and the query capabilities section advertising the types of predicates that may be used to form a query expression (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation, where applicable),
* a description of spatial object types offered by a download service instance (to be provided through the Describe Spatial Object Types operation).

EXAMPLE 2 Through the Transform function, a transformation service carries out data content transformations from native data forms to the INSPIRE-compliant form and vice versa. If this operation is directly called by an application to transform source data (e.g. obtained through a download service) that is not yet conformant with this data specification, the following parameters are required:

Input data (mandatory). The data set to be transformed.

* Source model (mandatory, if cannot be determined from the input data). The model in which the input data is provided.
* Target model (mandatory). The model in which the results are expected.
* Model mapping (mandatory, unless a default exists). Detailed description of how the transformation is to be carried out.

=== Encodings

The IRs contain the following two requirements for the encoding to be used to make data available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 7_
*Encoding*

{empty}1. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall conform to EN ISO 19118. In particular, it shall specify schema conversion rules for all spatial object types and all attributes and association roles and the output data structure used.

{empty}2. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall be made available.

{empty}2a. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall also specify whether and how to represent attributes and association roles for which a corresponding value exists but is not contained in the spatial data sets maintained by a Member State, or cannot be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.


====

NOTE ISO 19118:2011 specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules used for interchange of geographic data within the set of International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". An encoding rule allows geographic information defined by application schemas and standardized schemas to be coded into a system-independent data structure suitable for transport and storage. The encoding rule specifies the types of data being coded and the syntax, structure and coding schemes used in the resulting data structure. Specifically, ISO 19118:2011 includes

* requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas,
* requirements for creating encoding services, and
* requirements for XML-based encoding rules for neutral interchange of data.

While the IRs do not oblige the usage of a specific encoding, these Technical Guidelines propose to make data related to the spatial data theme _Production and Industrial Facilities_ available at least in the default encoding(s) specified in section 0. In this section, a number of TG requirements are listed that need to be met in order to be conformant with the default encoding(s).

The proposed default encoding(s) meet the requirements in Article 7 of the IRs, i.e. they are conformant with ISO 19118 and (since they are included in this specification) publicly available.

==== Default Encoding(s)

===== Specific requirements for GML encoding

This data specification proposes the use of GML as the default encoding, as recommended in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of [DS-D2.7]. GML is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118, as required in Article 7(1). For details, see [ISO 19136], and in particular Annex E (UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules).

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with GML encodings.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 6*

Data instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the provided XML schema.

====

NOTE 1 Not all constraints defined in the application schemas can be mapped to XML. Therefore, the following requirement is necessary.

NOTE 2 The obligation to use only the allowed code list values specified for attributes and most of the constraints defined in the application schemas cannot be mapped to the XML sch. They can therefore not be enforced through schema validation. It may be possible to express some of these constraints using other schema or rule languages (e.g. Schematron), in order to enable automatic validation.

== Data Capture

Facilities may be considered under INSPIRE scope if they meet with the following criteria:

* Information   related with the Activities performed on them shall be provided for the use or the benefit of the public, excluding strategic or private information not required by law. It can be used by other administrations or private companies as well.
* Based on the INSPIRE principles, the service can be used for environmental issues.
* Also, in order to full fill the INSPIRE Directive requirements, the information must be available as Digital Data.

Facilities-related data, due to their nature and the wide scope covered, may be captured and served by different data providers at different levels, mainly in the Public Administration. Due to this fact, it is expected that data will be stored at very different formats, scales and resolutions, covering different sub-sets of data, service types and different modelling approaches, depending on the concrete needs of their correspondent producers and target users.

The Geographical entities covered by the scope of Facilities cover a wide range of profiles and scales. In higher levels of the scale, geographical position is derived from tabular data, gazetteers or manual processing mostly based on geographic coordinates. Different Data Sets can follow parallel processes to geo-locate the same real world entities. In some cases there is no automatic interconnection through identifiers to establish the connection among datasets. This can make the merging of data sets a quite difficult process, prone to generating duplications or overlaps.

VAT codes (or other forms of fiscal identification codes) should not be assigned directly to a facility, as the VAT code identifies a legal entity, rather than a spatial entity, and is subject to temporal variations.

image::./media/image16.png[image,width=396,height=328, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Fig. 12 Range of Scopes covered under "Facilities"*

A basic set of recommendations is described in relation to generic facilities in this section, while the following sections provide more detailed requirements for _Production and Industrial Facilities_.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 29*

Given that (a) it is not expected that all of the available data sets are captured, produced and publicized by a single level of Public Administration Bodies and (b) that it may happen that these bodies be responsible for just one or several sub-sets of data, not necessarily categorizing the Activities following the NACE Code List, data should be transformed in such a way that at least the main class of the model (linked with Activity Complex) was categorized by at least one of the Activities listed within the NACE Code List in order to better arrange the interoperability.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 30*

If the current thematic Legislative Act sets certain parameters for accuracy in the Geographical location of the entities (Geographical Coordinates), these should be considered as the minimum level of accuracy under INSPIRE (e.g. _Location of the Holding_ under REGULATION (EC) No 1166/2008)

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 31*

In order to full fill the previous recommendation, datasets should be built by setting different layer groups for each of the main Activities covered (higher level of categorization following the NACE List).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 32*

In order to minimize the risk of geometric and positional inconsistency between different datasets on Economic Activities, when data about an instance is located by means of GM_Object, it is recommended to choose GM_Point as default.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 33*

When data about an instance of Economic Activities is located by means of a point or an address geo-location, this should correspond to the main access point to the space where the service is provided. Only verified locations should be provided in order to minimize accuracy errors.

====

=== Spatial object types

*Production and Industrial Facilities*

* ProductionSite
* ProductionFacility
* ProductionInstallation
* ProductionInstallationPart
* Production Plot

are considered as under the INSPIRE scope if:

* they fit with the definition given by the Directive "to full fill the definition and Description of 1.2 Informal description"
* they fit as much as possible with the description given in this document "geographic features related to production and industry", as well as geographic entities related to describing summary information about the activities taking place in production and industrial facilities, and the main environmental issues related to them (pollution prevention, waste management, risk).
* they are available as GM_Objects data:
** GM_Point
** GM_Curve
** GM_Surface
** GM_Solid


In conjunction with Bitmaps like Aerial Photography and Maps.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 34*

The selection rules for INSPIRE _Production and Industrial Facilities_ should be decided by each Member State, based on the guidelines given in this document and then documented as metadata, under lineage element.

====

NOTE _Production and Industrial Facilities_ should describe as much as possible, detailed use of geographical partitions of earth on the foundation of cadastral parcels. However, exploiting such reference will not be possible in each Member State, due to national regulations. These gaps and overlaps due to national regulations have been called respectively "gaps of industrial surveying" and information about _Production and Industrial Facilities_ has also to be given in metadata (lineage information).

==== Production and Industrial Site

====
*Recomendation 35*

[loweralpha]
. if they are available as GM_Objects (possibly with underlying bitmaps)
. if Member State considers them as helpful for users

=== INSPIRE Identifier (inspireId)

As explained in clause 5.2.1.4, all spatial objects published for INSPIRE shall carry a unique identifier: the "inspireId". This attribute must have the characteristics defined in the Generic Conceptual Model:

* be unique in the INSPIRE context
* be persistent (life-cycle rules being up to each Member State)
* give a way to find the download service where the spatial object is available
* be compliant with the lexical rules:
** *composed of a namespace and a local identifier*
** the namespace must begin with the two-letter country code
** the namespace and the local identifier can include only the limited set of characters allowed by the Generic Conceptual Model.

The following part of this clause gives some advices and examples to data providers about how they may supply such unique identifiers.

==== Namespace

The first point is to define a convenient *namespace*. To ensure both uniqueness within the INSPIRE context and possible link with download services, it may be useful to add to the mandatory country code, the data provider name or acronym.

For instance, namespace might be: NL.ProductionSite

==== Local identifier

The second point is to decide on the *local identifier* to be used. Of course, to ensure the required characteristics, this local identifier must be unique (in the local/national set of Production data), persistent, and must include only the limited set of characters allowed by the Generic Conceptual Model.

=== Estimated accuracy

For INSPIRE, Production And Industrial data shall be published in the Coordinate Reference System mandated by the Implementing Rule on Reference Systems, i.e. in ETRS89 for areas on the Eurasian tectonic plate and in ITRS elsewhere.

Of course, INSPIRE users will be interested by having information about the accuracy of Production And Industrial data, as they receive them, in the Coordinate Reference System mandated by INSPIRE. It is why the clauses about application schema and about quality and metadata require cadastral data providers to give estimated accuracy related to the coordinates in ETRS89 (or ITRS).

However, in most Member States, the estimated accuracy is generally known in the source Coordinate Reference System, the national or local one.

The estimated accuracy for INSPIRE will be the combination of estimated accuracy in original Coordinate Reference System and of the accuracy of the coordinate transformation between original Reference System to INSPIRE Reference System.

Coordinate transformation between two horizontal geodetic datum is generally done, using one of the three following methods:

* transformation with 3 parameters
* transformation with 7 parameters
* transformation with a grid.

Experience in some countries has shown that transformation with 3 or even 7 parameters might bring deviations up to 10 metres. So, the impact of such transformations may not be neglected on cadastral data whose original accuracy generally varies from some decimetres to some metres.

The ideal solution would be for each Member State to define good quality coordinate transformations (using grids and bringing no deviation bigger than some centimetres). However, if not possible before the deadlines of INSPIRE, the impact of coordinate transformation has to be taken into account when giving information about positional accuracy, both in the application schema and in metadata.

<<<
== Portrayal

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for this theme. Portrayal is regulated in Article 14 of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

. For the portrayal of spatial data sets using a view network service as specified in Commission Regulation No 976/2009 (footnote:[OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9.]), the following shall be available:
[loweralpha]
.. the layers specified in Annex II for the theme or themes the data set is related to;
.. for each layer at least a default portrayal style, with as a minimum an associated title and a unique identifier.

[arabic, start=2]
. For each layer, Annex II defines the following:
[loweralpha]
.. a human readable title of the layer to be used for display in user interface;
.. the spatial object type(s), or sub-set thereof, that constitute(s) the content of the layer.

====

In section 11.1, the _types_ of layers are defined that are to be used for the portrayal of the spatial object types defined in this specification. A view service may offer several layers of the same type, one for each dataset that it offers data on a specific topic.

NOTE The layer specification in the IRs only contains the name, a human readable title and the (subset(s) of) spatial object type(s), that constitute(s) the content of the layer. In addition, these Technical Guidelines suggest keywords for describing the layer.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 40*

It is recommended to use the keywords specified in section 11.1 in the _Layers Metadata parameters_ of the INSPIRE View service (see Annex III, Part A, section 2.2.4 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009).

====

Section 11.2 specifies one style for each of these layers. It is proposed that INSPIRE view services support this style as the default style required by Article 14(1b).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 7*

For each layer specified in this section, the styles defined in section 11.2 shall be available.

====

NOTE The default style should be used for portrayal by the view network service if no user-defined style is specified in a portrayal request for a specific layer.

In section 11.2.1, further styles can be specified that represent examples of styles typically used in a thematic domain. It is recommended that also these styles should be supported by INSPIRE view services, where applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 41*

In addition, it is recommended that, where applicable, INSPIRE view services also support the styles defined in section 11.2.1.

====

Where XML fragments are used in the following sections, the following namespace prefixes apply:

* sld="http://www.opengis.net/sld"Â (WMS/SLD 1.1)
* se="http://www.opengis.net/se"Â (SE 1.1)
* ogc="http://www.opengis.net/ogc"Â (FE 1.1)

== Abstract Test Suite - (normative) 

[cols=""]
|===
*Disclaimer*

While this Annex refers to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services, it does not replace the legal act or any part of it.
|===

The objective of the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) included in this Annex is to help the conformance testing process. It includes a set of tests to be applied on a data set to evaluate whether it fulfils the requirements included in this data specification and the corresponding parts of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010 (implementing rule as regards interoperability of spatial datasets and services, further referred to as ISDSS Regulation). This is to help data providers in declaring the conformity of a data set to the "degree of conformity, with implementing rules adopted under Article 7(1) of Directive 2007/2/EC", which is required to be provided in the data set metadata according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2008/1205 (the Metadata Regulation).

*Part 1* of this ATS includes tests that provide *input for assessing conformity with the ISDSS regulation.* In order to make visible which requirements are addressed by a specific test, references to the corresponding articles of the legal act are given. The way how the cited requirements apply to PF specification is described under the testing method.

In addition to the requirements included in ISDSS Regulation this Technical guideline contains TG requirements too. TG requirements are technical provisions that need to be fulfilled in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement when the specific technical implementation proposed in this document is used. Such requirements relate for example to the default encoding described in section 9. *Part 2* of the ATS presents tests necessary for assessing the *conformity with TG requirements*.

NOTE Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in this ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

The *ATS is applicable to the data sets that* *have been transformed* to be made available through INSPIRE download services (i.e. the data returned as a response to the mandatory "Get Spatial Dataset" operation) rather than the original "source" data sets.

The requirements to be tested are grouped in several _conformance classes_. Each of these classes covers a specific aspect: one conformance class contains tests reflecting the requirements on the application schema, another on the reference systems, etc. *Each conformance class is identified by a URI* (uniform resource identifier) according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/PF/<conformance class identifier>

EXAMPLE 1 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ef/rs_ identifies the Reference Systems ISDSS conformance class of the Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF) data theme.

The results of the tests should be published referring to the relevant conformance class (using its URI).

When an INSPIRE data specification contains *more than one application schema,* the requirements tested in a conformance class may differ depending on the application schema used as a target for the transformation of the data set. This will always be the case for the application schema conformance class. However, also other conformance classes could have different requirements for different application schemas. In such cases, a separate conformance class is defined for each application schema, and they are distinguished by specific URIs according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/PF/<conformance class identifier>/ 
<application schema namespace prefix>

EXAMPLE 2 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/el/as/el-vec_ identifies the conformity with the application schema (_as_) conformance class for the Elevation Vector Elements (_el-vec_) application schema.

An overview of the conformance classes and the associated tests is given in the table below.

|===

In order to be conformant to a conformance class, a data set has to pass *all* tests defined for that conformance class.

In order to be conformant with the ISDSS regulation the inspected data set needs to be conformant to *all* conformance classes in Part 1. The conformance class for overall conformity with the ISDSS regulation is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/PF/._

In order to be conformant with the Technical Guidelines, the dataset under inspection needs to be conformant to all conformance classes included both in Part 1 and 2. Chapter 8 describes in detail how to publish the result of testing regarding overall conformity and conformity with the conformance classes as metadata. The conformance class for overall conformity with the Technical Guidelines is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/tg/PF/x.y.(z)._

It should be noted that data providers are not obliged to integrate / decompose the original structure of the source data sets when they deliver them for INSPIRE. It means that a conformant dataset can contain less or more spatial object / data types than specified in the ISDSS Regulation.

*A dataset that contains less spatial object and/or data types* can be regarded conformant when the corresponding types of the source datasets after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation.

A *dataset that contain more spatial object and/or data types* may be regarded as conformant when

* all the spatial object / data types that have corresponding types in the source dataset after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation and
* all additional elements of the source model (spatial object types, data types, attributes, constraints, code lists and enumerations together with their values) do not conflict with any rule defined in the interoperability target specifications defined for any theme within INSPIRE.

The ATS contains a detailed list of abstract tests. It should be noted that some tests in the Application schema conformance class can be automated by utilising xml *schema validation tools.* It should be noted that failing such validation test does not necessary reflect non-compliance to the application schema; it may be the results of erroneous encoding.

Each test in this suit follows the same structure:

* Requirement: citation from the legal texts (ISDSS requirements) or the Technical Guidelines (TG requirements);
* Purpose: definition of the scope of the test;
* Reference: link to any material that may be useful during the test;
* Test method: description of the testing procedure.

According to ISO 19105:2000 all tests in this ATS are basic tests. Therefore, this statement is not repeated each time.

== Part 1 - (normative)

*Conformity with Commission Regulation No 1089/2010*

=== Application Schema Conformance Class

*Conformance class:*

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/pf/as/pf

==== Schema element denomination test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether each element of the dataset under inspection carries a name specified in the target application schema(s).

. [.underline]#Reference#: Art. 3 and Art.4 of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether the corresponding elements of the source schema (spatial object types, data types, attributes, association roles, code lists, and enumerations) are mapped to the target schema with the correct designation of mnemonic names.

NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Value type test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether all attributes or association roles use the corresponding value types specified in the application schema(s).

. [.underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4, Art.6(1), Art.6(4), Art.6(5) and Art.9(1)of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether the value type of each provided attribute or association role adheres to the corresponding value type specified in the target specification.

NOTE 1 This test comprises testing the value types of INSPIRE identifiers, the value types of attributes and association roles that should be taken from enumeration and code lists, and the coverage domains.

NOTE 2 Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Value test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether all attributes or association roles whose value type is a code list or enumeration take the values set out therein.

. [.underline]#Reference#: Art.4 (3) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

. [.underline]#Test Method#: When an attribute / association role has an enumeration or code list as its type, compare the values of each instance with those provided in the application schema. To pass this tests any instance of an attribute / association role
+
* shall take only values explicitly specified in the code list when the code list's extensibility is "none".
* shall take only a value explicitly specified in the code list or shall take a value that is narrower (i.e. more specific) than those explicitly specified in the application schema when the code list's extensibility is "narrower".


NOTE 1 This test is not applicable to code lists with extensibility "open" or "any".

NOTE 2 When a data provider only uses code lists with narrower (more specific values) this test can be fully performed based on internal information.

==== Attributes/associations completeness test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether each instance of spatial object type and data types include all attributes and association roles as defined in the target application schema.

. [.underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4(1), Art.4(2), and Art.5(2) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether all attributes and association roles defined for a spatial object type or data type are present for each instance in the dataset.

NOTE 1 Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

NOTE 2 For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided if it exists in or applies to the real world entity â€“ either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ If the characteristic described by the attribute or association role does not exist in or apply to the real world entity, the attribute or association role does not need to be present in the data set.

==== Abstract spatial object test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the dataset does NOT contain abstract spatial object / data types defined in the target application schema(s).

. [.underline]#Reference#: Art.5(3) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine that there are NO instances of abstract spatial object / data types in the dataset provided.

NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Constraints test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the instances of spatial object and/or data types provided in the dataset adhere to the constraints specified in the target application schema(s).

. [.underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4(1), and Art.4(2) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine all instances of data for the constraints specified for the corresponding spatial object / data type. Each instance shall adhere to all constraints specified in the target application schema(s).

NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Geometry representation test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the value domain of spatial properties is restricted as specified in the Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

. [.underline]#Reference#: Art.12(1), Annex III Section 9 of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Check whether all spatial properties only use 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometric objects that exist in the right 2-, 3- or 4-dimensional coordinate space, and where all curve interpolations respect the rules specified in the reference documents.

NOTE Further technical information is in OGC Simple Feature spatial schema v1.2.1 [06-103r4].

=== Reference Systems Conformance Class

*Conformance class:*

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformanceClass/ir/pf/rs

==== Datum test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether each instance of a spatial object type is given with reference to one of the (geodetic) datums specified in the target specification.

. [.underline]#Reference#: Annex II Section 1.2 of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Check whether each instance of a spatial object type specified in the application schema(s) in section 5 has been expressed using:
+
* the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) within its geographical scope; or
* the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) for areas beyond the ETRS89 geographical scope; or
* other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with the ITRS. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of ITRS and there is a well-established and described relationship between both systems, according to the EN ISO 19111.

NOTE Further technical information is given in Section 6 of this document.

==== Coordinate reference system test

[loweralpha]
. [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether the two- and three-dimensional coordinate reference systems are used as defined in section 6.

. [.underline]#Reference#: Section 6 of Commission Regulation 1089/2010.

. [.underline]#Test Method#: Inspect whether the horizontal and vertical components of coordinates one of the corresponding coordinate reference system has been:
+
* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.
* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.
* Two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate reference system.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Transverse Mercator coordinate reference system.
* For the vertical component on land, the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) shall be used to express gravity-related heights within its geographical scope. Other vertical reference systems related to the Earth gravity field shall be used to express gravity-related heights in areas that are outside the geographical scope of EVRS.
* For the vertical component in marine areas where there is an appreciable tidal range (tidal waters), the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) shall be used as the reference surface.
* For the vertical component in marine areas without an appreciable tidal range, in open oceans and effectively in waters that are deeper than 200 meters, the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or a well-defined reference level close to the MSL shall be used as the reference surface."
* For the vertical component in the free atmosphere, barometric pressure, converted to height using ISO 2533:1975 International Standard Atmosphere, or other linear or parametric reference systems shall be used. Where other parametric reference systems are used, these shall be described in an accessible reference using EN ISO 19111-2:2012.


NOTE Further technical information is given in Section 6 of this document.

==== View service coordinate reference system test

[loweralpha]

== Use cases - (informative)

Developing Use-Cases is a powerful method for creating information products, which has been adopted for INSPIRE data specification process. The INSPIRE Methodology for Data Specification Development (D2.6) foresees a user-driven specification method based on use-case development. This approach has been followed during the development of the Annex I Data themes and is now followed by the Annex II and III Thematic Working Groups (TWGs).

Development of common Use-Cases would not only show possible inter-linkages and dependencies among INSPIRE Data themes, also serve as a real demonstrator of the interoperability of the INSPIRE data specifications.

This annex describes the use cases that were used as a basis for the development of this data specification.

In addition to the basic use case descriptions according to the templates required by the data specifications, additional information is provided, such as excerpts from the legislation, highlighting references to spatial features of relevance.

=== Seveso II and Seveso III

This use case is focused on planning and monitoring actions related to application of the *Directive 96/82/EC (Seveso II)*, and the amending *Directive 2003/105/EC (Seveso III)*, with the aim of preventing major accidents that involve dangerous substances, and to limit their consequences for people and the environment. The Seveso Directives applies to establishments (industrial plants) at which certain dangerous substances are present in sufficiently large quantities to create a major accident hazard. As well as requiring the operators of such establishments to take preventive measures the Directives place a number of procedural requirements on Member States relating to planning, policy integration, inspection, reporting and public access to information.

==== Background Legislation

*Council Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, as amended by Directive 2003/105/EC*

Article 2: Scope
The Directive shall apply to establishments where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or in excess of the quantities listed in Annex I, Parts 1 and 2, column 2, with the exception of Articles 9, 11 and 13 which shall apply to any establishment where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or in excess of the quantities listed in Annex I, Parts 1 and 2, column 3.

The Directive sets out two levels of requirements corresponding to 'lower tier' and 'upper tier' establishments.

*Article 7: Major-accident prevention policy*

Member States shall require the operator to draw up a document setting out his major-accident prevention policy and to ensure that it is properly implemented. The major-accident prevention policy established by the operator shall be designed to guarantee a high level of protection for man and the environment by appropriate means, structures and management systems.

There is a requirement for lower tier establishments to draw up a Major Accident Prevention Policy (MAPP), designed to guarantee a high level of protection for man and the environment by appropriate means including appropriate management systems, taking account of the principles contained in Annex III of the Directive. The operator of an 'upper tier' establishment (covered by Article 9 of the Directive and corresponding to a larger inventory of hazardous substances) is required to demonstrate in the 'safety report' that a MAPP and a Safety Management System (SMS) for implementing it have been put into effect in accordance with the information set out in Annex III of the Directive.

*Article 9: Safety report*

. Member States shall require the operator to produce a safety report for the purposes of:
[loweralpha]
.. demonstrating that a major-accident prevention policy and a safety management system for implementing it have been put into effect in accordance with the information set out in Annex III;
.. demonstrating that major-accident hazards have been identified and that the necessary measures have been taken to prevent such accidents and to limit their consequences for man and the environment;
.. demonstrating that adequate safety and reliability have been incorporated into the design, construction, operation and maintenance of any installation, storage facility, equipment and infrastructure connected with its operation which are linked to major-accident hazards inside the establishment;
.. demonstrating that internal emergency plans have been drawn up and supplying information to enable the external plan to be drawn up in order to take the necessary measures in the event of a major accident;
.. providing sufficient information to the competent authorities to enable decisions to be made in terms of the sitting of new activities or developments around existing establishments.

[arabic, start=2]
. The safety report shall contain at least the data and information listed in Annex II. .It shall name the relevant organizations involved in the drawing up of the report. It shall also contain an updated inventory of the dangerous substances present in the establishment.
+
Safety reports, or parts of reports, or any other equivalent reports produced in response to other legislation, may be combined to form a single safety report for the purposes of this Article, where such a format obviates the unnecessary duplication of information and the repetition of work by the operator or competent authority, on condition that all the requirements of this Article are complied with.

*Article 11: Emergency plans*

. Member States shall ensure that, for all establishments covered by Article 9 (Safety Report):
[loweralpha]
.. the operator draws up an internal emergency plan to be taken inside the factory: [...]
.. the operator supplies to the competent authorities, within the time specified below, information that will enable them to process the external emergency plan: [...]

[arabic, start=2]
. Emergency plans are developed in order to:
[loweralpha]
.. Containing and controlling incidents so as to minimize their effects and to limit damage to man, the environment and property;
.. Implementing the measures necessary to protect humans and the environment from the consequences of major accidents;
.. Inform the public and to the services or the appropriate local authorities;
.. Providing for the restoration and cleaning up the environment after a major accident.
.. The plans contain the information specified in Annex IV.
.. In order to limit the consequences of these accidents, it is necessary to develop external (EEP) and internal emergency plans (IEP) â€“ applicable for that industrial establishment. The internal emergency plan comprises measures that shall be enforced within the establishment, by the operator and its employees, whereas the external one includes measures enforceableby the authorities for areas out of the establishment boundaries.

The EEP is drawn up using the information provided by the local authorities and institutions, as well as the data offered by the economic operator in the Safety Report (SR), the Internal Emergency Plan (IEP) and public information documents.

*Article 12 - Land-use planning*

Member States shall ensure that their land-use and/or other relevant policies and the procedures for implementing those policies take account of the need, in the long term, to maintain appropriate distances between establishments covered by this Directive and residential areas, areas of public use and areas of particular natural sensitivity or interest, and, in the case of existing establishments, of the need for additional technical measures in accordance with Article 8 so as not to increase the risks to people.

Member States shall define minimum safety requirements for territorial and town-planning for places interested by major-accident establishments with reference to the destination and use of grounds, correlated to the necessity of maintaining adequate distances between establishments and vulnerable zones, preventing important accidents, and limiting consequences for man and environment.

=== Licensing Procedure according to IPPC/IED

This use case is focused on planning and monitoring actions related to application of the *DIRECTIVE 2010/75/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) (Recast) (Text with EEA relevance)*, with the aim of establishing a general framework for the control of the main industrial activities and to facilitate the granting of permits.

The IED is based on several principles, namely (1) an integrated approach, (2) best available techniques, (3) flexibility, (4) inspections and (5) public participation.

[arabic, start=1]
. The integrated approach means that the permits must take into account the whole environmental performance of the plant, covering e.g. emissions to air, water and land, generation of waste, use of raw materials, energy efficiency, noise, prevention of accidents, and restoration of the site upon closure. The purpose of the Directive is to ensure a high level o   f protection of the environment taken as a whole.

Should the activity involve the use, production or release of relevant hazardous substances, the IED requires operators to prepare a baseline report before starting an operation of an installation or before a permit is updated having regard to the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination, ensuring the integrated approach.

[arabic, start=2]
. The permit conditions including emission limit values (ELVs) must be based on the Best Available Techniques (BAT), as defined in the IPPC Directive. BAT conclusions (documents containing information on the emission levels associated with the best available techniques) shall be the reference for setting permit conditions. To assist the licensing authorities and companies to determine BAT, the Commission organises an exchange of information between experts from the EU Member States, industry and environmental organisations. This work is coordinated by the European IPPC Bureau of the Institute for Prospective Technology Studies at the EU Joint Research Centre in Seville (Spain). This results in the adoption and publication by the Commission of the BAT conclusions and BAT Reference Documents (the so-called BREFs).

[arabic, start=3]
. The IED contains certain elements of flexibility by allowing the licensing authorities to set less strict emission limit values in specific cases. Such measures are only applicable where an assessment shows that the achievement of emission levels associated with BAT as described in the BAT conclusions would lead to disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits due to (a) geographical location or the local environmental conditions or (b) the technical characteristics of the installation.

The IED contains mandatory requirements on environmental inspections. Member States shall set up a system of environmental inspections and draw up inspection plans accordingly. The IED requires a site visit shall take place at least every 1 to 3 years, using risk-based criteria.

The Directive ensures that the public has a right to participate in the decision-making process, and to be informed of its consequences, by having access to

[loweralpha]
. permit applications in order to give opinions,
. permits,
. results of the monitoring of releases and
. the _European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR)_. In E-PRTR, emission data reported by Member States are made accessible in a public register, which is intended to provide environmental information on major industrial activities.
