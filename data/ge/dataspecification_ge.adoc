== How to read the document?

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Geology – Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.0 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _Geology_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Geology_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Geology_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services – General Executive Summary

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services,] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML – Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== Geology – Executive Summary

In the INSPIRE context _Geology_ could be seen as a "reference data theme" as it provides information for several themes of Annex III: Mineral resources, Natural Risk Zones, Soil, Energy resources, and it has a specific relationship with one of the most important natural resources, water, through groundwater bodies contained in aquifers. Geomorphology describes the Earth's present-day surface, and the processes creating its geometry.

*The use of geological data*

Geological data are used in various domains requiring knowledge of the surface and underground geological environment: detecting geo-hazards; ensuring the safe disposal of wastes, nuclear wastes, carbon capture and storage; ensuring the safe construction of buildings; providing information for environmental planning; providing information for natural resources exploration; vulnerability of the underground to contamination; providing indicators for climatic change; providing construction material and minerals. For groundwater and aquifers uses are: water supply (water abstraction); groundwater resources (water availability); providing base flow for rivers, wetlands; protecting ecosystems dependent on groundwater; groundwater quality and quantity assessment; transboundary groundwater management.

*How geoscientists could provide this useful information?*

Geological information provides basic knowledge about the physical properties and composition of the geologic materials (rocks and sediments) outcropping at the land's surface and forming the underground, and about their structure and their age. It also provides knowledge about aquifers, i.e. subsurface units of rocks or sediments of sufficient porosity and permeability to allow either a significant flow of groundwater or the abstraction of significant quantities of groundwater. Knowledge about landforms is also provided.

The main product delivered by geologists for the users is a *geological map* which is the result of an *interpretation* of the observations and measurements made on rocks and sediments, on and under the surface. Because the rocks forming the subsurface are visible or accessible only on very small parts of the surface, the outcrops, geologists have to interpret these observations and measurements to group rocks in geologic units, and to connect other information observed locally to identify the general geological structure.

*Boreholes* are another important source of information for interpreting the subsurface geology. These can provide a stratigraphic and lithological log, analogous to a vertical geological map, and can also be used to gather samples and make measurements of various properties at depth.

All this information is interpreted to make geological maps. The *landforms* (geomorphologic features) are often indicated on general geological maps, and are detailed on specific, applied geomorphological maps.

*Hydrogeological information*

*Hydrogeology* describes the flow, occurrence, and behavior of water in the underground environment. It is a science located between hydrology and geology, and both have a strong influence on the understanding of groundwater flow and solute transport. Hydrological processes are responsible, for example, for the characterization and understanding of water supply derived from recharge of aquifers. On the other hand the physical properties and composition of the geologic materials (rocks and sediments) create the main environment for groundwater flow and storage. Rocks and sediments also influence groundwater quality in terms of their chemical composition.

The INSPIRE groundwater model describes two basic elements: the rock system (including aquifers, dependent on the geological condition) and the groundwater system (including groundwater bodies), completed by hydrogeological objects (such as water wells). See annex C for a detailed description of this domain.

*Geophysical information*

Since geophysics provides valuable information on the physical properties of rocks (like density, porosity, magnetic susceptibility, etc.), regardless of their organization as geologic units, geophysics is part of the INSPIRE Geological data specifications. Geophysical boundaries may or may not coincide with geological boundaries, depending on the changes of physical properties within and outside the geological units. Geophysics provides extra - quite often the only - information on the organization of the units in the subsurface. These results are processed by geophysicists in order to deliver the 1D, 2D, 3D or even 4D spatial distribution of the property. The spatial property distributions are then interpreted by geologists to build geological models of the subsurface, for instance to detect hydrocarbon bearing structures or zones of mineral resources.

Which geological data to provide through INSPIRE?

Based on the analysis of the potential types of users and identification of use cases the TWG developed a core data model. It is based on the complex GeoSciML data model, developed by the international geosciences community, in particular Geological Survey Organisations (_http://www.geosciml.org/_).

The core data model contains the main types of GeologicFeatures (GeologicUnits, GeologicStructures, and GeomorphologicFeatures). The geometry of these features is described in MappedFeatures and can be included in geological maps and profiles in the form of points, lines and polygons. The data model also enables a description of the lithological/stratigraphical characteristics of borehole logs, thematic maps, geophysical surveys and measurements, and features related to hydrogeology (aquifers and groundwater bodies).

Basic geological knowledge and applied maps

As mentioned above, _Geology_ is used by other thematic domains which are interested only in specific properties of the underground (to prevent landslides, to insure safe disposal of wastes etc). Geological surveys provide the basic knowledge about the Earth, but this basic information must then be processed by experts to transform it into the specific maps (named applied maps) required by thematic users. As very often the needs of thematic users concern a local area, the basic knowledge must be supplemented by new data related to specific properties (for example the porosity of the local rocks is needed in an assessment of a landslide).

*The INSPIRE Geology model provides elements to* build applied maps but does not describe these applied features.

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Geology_ as defined in Annex II of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme _Geology_.

=== Informal description

*Definition:*

_Geology_ characterised according to composition and structure. Includes bedrock, aquifers and geomorphology [Directive 2007/2/EC].

*Description*

From the definition, we detail each word. *Geology* is the study of the past and present aspects of the Earth, including its history and life on Earth.

The *composition* of an earth material describes what it consists of (its components), both the weight percentage of elements or molecules (chemical composition), and the species and number of particles, e.g. minerals (mineralogical composition), clasts and fossils.

The *structure* of an earth material describes the physical arrangements of its components. A geologic structure is a configuration of matter in the Earth based on describable inhomogeneity, pattern, or fracture in an earth material.

The composition and structure of earth materials

* are reflected by their physical properties (e.g. density, porosity, and mechanical, magnetic, electrical, seismic and hydraulic properties)
* influence geological processes (genesis, fracturing, alteration)
* control the properties of aquifers
* control the morphology of the landscape
* control their use as a natural resources
* determine their behavior during natural and industrial processes

The *bedrock* is a general term for the rock, usually solid, that underlies soil or other unconsolidated, superficial material.

*Aquifer* is a wet underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, silt, or clay) from which groundwater can be usefully extracted using a water well.

*Groundwater* is all water which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil. This zone is commonly referred to as an aquifer.

*Groundwater body* is a distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer. Generally the groundwater body is not exactly correlated with the main (deeper) groundwater aquifers because it was based on the surface water basins. This means that an aquifer is not always equivalent to a groundwater body (GWB) (the methodology differs in different member states).

*Geomorphology* provides basic knowledge about the present shape of the sub-aerial and submerged parts of the Earth surface and its dynamics (genesis and involved processes).

The analysis of reference material and examples of use, briefly described in the Executive Summary, shows the wide range of uses with various sets of rock properties required for different uses: a geologist in charge of mineral prospecting, or mining waste protection, does not request the same information about rocks as an engineer dealing with natural hazards who is more interested in underground stability.

This data specification defines three application schemas: Geology, Hydrogeology, and Geophysics to provide the basic geological, hydrogeological and geophysical knowledge on an area, with agreed sets of attributes. To demonstrate the extensibility and also to cover more specific geological and geophysical requirements two extension application schemas for _Geology_ and Geophysics where defined (see Annex D).

*The Geological data model contains:*

* Geologic Features with Geologic Events, Geologic Units, Geologic Structures, and Geomorphologic Features. The geometry of these features is described in Mapped Features, and is included in geological maps and profiles in the form of points, lines and polygons. Mapped Features and Boreholes can be bundled in Collections,
* Thematic Class for reclassifying GeologicFeatures as some thematic class for thematic maps,
* The lithology of rock units,
* The processes of Geologic Events and their environments and ages
* The types of Shear Displacement Structures and Folds
* Borehole details, such as location and purpose.

*The Geophysics data model* provides essential information on the physical properties of geological structures. The data model includes:

* High rank geophysical stations that are part of international and national observation networks
* Important types of geophysical measurements that are most often requested or provided by stakeholders
* Measurements that have basic role in improving geological knowledge, especially in environmental and engineering context.
* Measurement campaigns that include any number of measurements and allow data providers to deliver metadata in a collective manner.

*The Hydrogeological data model* contains:

* The Aquifer System comprising HydrogeologicUnits, Aquifers, Aquitards, Aquicludes and the AquiferSystem,
* The Groundwater System comprising GroundWaterBody, and its relationships to the Aquifer System, Hydrogeology Objects, and WFD_GroundWaterBody
* Hydrogeology Objects, both natural and man-made, including Wells

*Extensibility of the INSPIRE geology models:*

* For geology: the possibility of using GeoSciML v 3.2 for a wide range of geoscientific information is discussed in the Annex D,
* For geophysics: guidance and examples are included to demonstrate the usage of the Observations & Measurements schema in delivering measurement and processing results.

*Definition:*

_Geology_ characterised according to composition and structure. Includes bedrock, aquifers and geomorphology [Directive 2007/2/EC].

*Description:*

In the INSPIRE context the _Geology_ data theme can be seen as a "reference data theme" as it provides information for several other INSPIRE data themes e.g. Mineral resources; Area Management, Restriction and Regulation Zones; Natural Risk Zones; Soil; Energy resources. In _Geology_ there is a specific relationship with one of the most important natural resources, water, through groundwater bodies contained in aquifers. The theme also covers geomorphology that describes the Earth's present-day surface, and the location of the geophysical campaigns and measurements that provide valuable information on the physical properties of rocks (like density, porosity, magnetic susceptibility, etc.) regardless of their organization as geologic units.

The INSPIRE _Geology_ Theme is split into the following sub-themes:

• Geology: provides basic knowledge about the physical properties and composition of geologic materials (rocks and sediments), their structure and their age as depicted in geological maps, as well as landforms (geomorphological features). The model also covers boreholes - another important source of information for interpreting the subsurface geology.

• Hydrogeology: describes the flow, occurrence, and behaviour of water in the subsurface environment. The two basic elements are the rock system (including aquifers) and the groundwater system (including groundwater bodies). Man-made or natural hydrogeological objects/features (such as groundwater wells and natural springs) are also included.

• Geophysics: focuses on the availability and location of key geophysical features. It includes metadata on high rank gravity, magnetic and seismological stations that are part of international and national observation networks as well as metadata on 2D and 3D seismic measurements that are most often requested by third party users. It also provides collective metadata on gravity, magnetic and airborne geophysical campaigns that cover large areas and provide basic geological information for scientific research and more detailed applied studies e.g. exploring earth resources (hydrocarbons, mineral deposits, ground water, geothermal energy...).

=== Terms and definitions

General terms and definitions helpful for understanding the INSPIRE data specification documents are defined in the INSPIRE Glossaryfootnote:[The INSPIRE Glossary is available from http://inspire-registry.jrc.ec.europa.eu/registers/GLOSSARY].

Specifically, for the theme _Geology_, the following terms are defined:

*(1) GeologicFeature*

The abstract GeologicFeature class represents a conceptual feature that is hypothesized to exist coherently in the world. This corresponds with a "legend item" from a traditional geologic map * while the bounding coordinates of a Geologic Feature may be described, its shape is not. The implemented Geologic Feature instance acts as the "description package"

*(2) MappedFeature*

A spatial representation of a GeologicFeature. A MappedFeature is part of a geological interpretation.

It provides a link between a notional feature (description package) and one spatial representation of it, or part of it (exposures, surface traces and intercepts, etc) which forms the specific bounded occurrence, such as an outcrop or map polygon.

*(3) Geologic Unit*

A volume of rock with distinct characteristics. Includes both formal units (i.e. formally adopted and named in an official lexicon) and informal units (i.e. named but not promoted to the lexicon) and unnamed units (i.e. recognisable and described and delineable in the field but not otherwise formalised). Spatial properties are only available through association with a MappedFeature.

*(4) Geologic Structure*

Geologic Structure, in the INSPIRE context, considers shear displacement structures (including faults) and folds. A shear displacement structure is defined as a brittle to ductile style structure along which displacement has occurred. A fold is defined as one or more systematically curved layers, surfaces, or lines in a rock body.

*(5) Hydrogeologic Unit*

A Hydrogeologic Unit is a volume of rock that by virtue of its porosity or permeability has a distinct influence on the storage or movement of groundwater.

*(6) Aquifer*

A wet underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, silt, or clay) from which groundwater can be usefully extracted using a water well.

*(7) Groundwater Body*

A distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or system of aquifers, which is hydraulically isolated from nearby groundwater bodies.

*(8) Geophysical Station*

Geophysical measurement spatially referenced to a single point location.

*(9) Geophysical Profile*

Geophysical measurement spatially referenced to a curve.

*(10) Geophysical Swath*

Geophysical measurement spatially referenced to a surface.

*(11) Campaign*

Geophysical activity extending over a limited time range and limited area for producing similar geophysical measurements, processing results or models.

*Error! Not a valid link.*

=== How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 1 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Geology_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme _Geology_ in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:


[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).
====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:


[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X* 

This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.
====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X* 

Recommendations are shown using this style.
====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

<<<
== Specification scopes

This data specification does not distinguish different specification scopes, but just considers one general scope.

NOTE For more information on specification scopes, see [ISO 19131:2007], clause 8 and Annex D.

<<<
== Identification information

These Technical Guidelines are identified by the following URI:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/tg/ge/3.0

NOTE ISO 19131 suggests further identification information to be included in this section, e.g. the title, abstract or spatial representation type. The proposed items are already described in the document metadata, executive summary, overview description (section 2) and descriptions of the application schemas (section 5). In order to avoid redundancy, they are not repeated here.

== Data content and structure

=== Application schemas – Overview 

==== Application schemas included in the IRs

Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Implementing Rules lay down the requirements for the content and structure of the data sets related to the INSPIRE Annex themes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 4_
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme Geology are defined in the following application schemas (see sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5):

* Geology application schema
* Hydrogeology application schema
* Geophysics application schema

All 3 application schemas provide basic geological, hydrogeological and geophysical knowledge on an area, with an agreed set of attributes.

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

NOTE The application schemas presented in this section contain some additional information that is not included in the Implementing Rules, in particular multiplicities of attributes and association roles.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 1*

Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the multiplicities defined for the attributes and association roles in this section.

====

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

==== Additional recommended application schemas 

In addition to the application schemas listed above, the following additional application schema have been defined for the theme _Geology_ (see Annex D):

* Geophysics extension application schema to share e.g. geophysical observation results in a harmonised way using ISO 19156 (O&M) Standard.

These additional application schemas are not included in the IRs. They typically address requirements from specific (groups of) use cases and/or may be used to provide additional information. They are included in this specification in order to improve interoperability also for these additional aspects and to illustrate the extensibility of the application schemas included in the IRs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

Additional and/or use case-specific information related to the theme _Geology_ should be made available using the spatial object types and data types specified in the following application schema: - *Geophysics extension*

These spatial object types and data types should comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles defined in the Annex D.

The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types should comply with the definitions and include the values defined in the Annex D.

====

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema – across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 5_
*Types*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.

. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 1 below.

[.text-center]
*Table 1 – Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[cols=",,",options="header"]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The «voidable» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided – either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 2*

The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The «voidable» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the «voidable» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the «voidable» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=5]
. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

. Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:
[loweralpha]
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;
.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;
.. code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 3*

Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 6_
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.

. Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 4*

Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows.


INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>/<value>.


* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined.


Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists.

The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:


* The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.

* The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".

* In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.

* The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones.

Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.


[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 5*

The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<UpperCamelCaseName>_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "\{complete,disjoint}".

==== Identifier management

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.

. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

====

NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier which is published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. [DS-D2.5]

NOTE 2 Article 9(1) is implemented in each application schema by including the attribute _inspireId_ of type Identifier.

NOTE 3 Article 9(2) is ensured if the _namespace_ and _localId_ attributes of the Identifier remains the same for different versions of a spatial object; the _version_ attribute can of course change.

==== Geometry representation

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_
*Other Requirements & Rules*

. The value domain of spatial properties defined in this Regulation shall be restricted to the Simple Feature spatial schema as defined in Herring, John R. (ed.), OpenGIS® Implementation Standard for Geographic information – Simple feature access – Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 10_
*Life-cycle of Spatial Objects*

(...)

[arabic, start=3]
. Where the attributes beginLifespanVersion and endLifespanVersion are used, the value of endLifespanVersion shall not be before the value of beginLifespanVersion.

====

NOTE The requirement expressed in the IR Requirement above will be included as constraints in the UML data models of all themes.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 6*

If life-cycle information is not maintained as part of the spatial data set, all spatial objects belonging to this data set should provide a void value with a reason of "unpopulated".

====

===== Validity of the real-world phenomena

The application schema(s) use(s) the attributes "validFrom" and "validTo" to record the validity of the real-world phenomenon represented by a spatial object.

The attributes "validFrom" specifies the date and time at which the real-world phenomenon became valid in the real world. The attribute "validTo" specifies the date and time at which the real-world phenomenon is no longer valid in the real world.

Specific application schemas may give examples what "being valid" means for a specific real-world phenomenon represented by a spatial object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*

. Where the attributes validFrom and validTo are used, the value of validTo shall not be before the value of validFrom.

====

NOTE The requirement expressed in the IR Requirement above will be included as constraints in the UML data models of all themes.

==== Coverages

Coverage functions are used to describe characteristics of real-world phenomena that vary over space and/or time. Typical examples are temperature, elevation, precipitation, imagery. A coverage contains a set of such values, each associated with one of the elements in a spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal domain. Typical spatial domains are point sets (e.g. sensor locations), curve sets (e.g. isolines), grids (e.g. orthoimages, elevation models), etc.

In INSPIRE application schemas, coverage functions are defined as properties of spatial object types where the type of the property value is a realisation of one of the types specified in ISO 19123.

To improve alignment with coverage standards on the implementation level (e.g. ISO 19136 and the OGC Web Coverage Service) and to improve the cross-theme harmonisation on the use of coverages in INSPIRE, an application schema for coverage types is included in the Generic Conceptual Model in 9.9.4. This application schema contains the following coverage types:

* _RectifiedGridCoverage_: coverage whose domain consists of a rectified grid – a grid for which there is an affine transformation between the grid coordinates and the coordinates of a coordinate reference system (see Figure 2, left).
* _ReferenceableGridCoverage_: coverage whose domain consists of a referenceable grid – a grid associated with a transformation that can be used to convert grid coordinate values to values of coordinates referenced to a coordinate reference system (see Figure 2, right).

In addition, some themes make reference to the types TimeValuePair and Timeseries defined in Taylor, Peter (ed.), _OGC^®^ WaterML 2.0: Part 1 – Timeseries, v2.0.0,_ Open Geospatial Consortium, 2012. These provide a representation of the time instant/value pairs, i.e. time series (see Figure 3).

Where possible, only these coverage types (or a subtype thereof) are used in INSPIRE application schemas.

==== Description

===== Narrative description and UML Overview

image::./media/image7.png[image,width=603,height=269, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 4 – UML class diagram: Overview of the Geology application schema*

Figure 4 shows only the spatial object types and their relationships. It does not include data types and code-lists. The properties are not visible but are shown in the following figures, which describe the main parts of the Geology data model.

image::./media/image8.png[image,width=604,height=488, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 5 – UML class diagram: GeologicFeature, MappedFeature, GeologicEvent, ThematicClass*

_MappedFeature_ and _GeologicFeature_ are central classes (spatial object types) in the model.

A _MappedFeature_ provides a spatial representation of a _GeologicFeature_. The _specification_ association from _MappedFeature_ to _GeologicFeature_ allows only one Geologic Feature to be represented by any Mapped Feature.

As well as 'standard' geological maps the model allows the description of thematic maps using the _themeClass_ association to _ThematicClass_. A thematic map in this context can be considered as a reclassification of the GeologicUnit in terms of some thematic property, for example reclassifying Geologic Units in terms of their susceptibility to compaction or their potential as a source of aggregate. A theme should have a name and be constrained by a codelist of class values for that theme but as each theme will have different classes, and it is likely different classification systems will have been used by different data providers, it is not possible to mandate any particular codelist of theme class values in the specification.

The abstract _GeologicFeature_ class represents a conceptual geological feature that is hypothesized to exist coherently in the world, and includes as sub-types the main information classes in the model. The implemented Geologic Feature instance acts as the "description package". There are three sub-types of _GeologicFeature_ in the data model: _GeologicUnit, GeologicStructure and GeomorphologicFeature._

A _GeologicEvent_ is defined as an identifiable event during which one or more geological processes act to modify geological entities. Geological age is modelled using _GeologicEvent_ – the age of some geological event occurring. A _GeologicEvent_ should have a specified geologic age and process, and may have a specified environment.

The _geologicHistory_ association from _GeologicFeature_ to _GeologicEvent_ describes a sequence of one or more Geologic Events which together describe the age or geologic history of the GeologicFeature. Commonly GeologicFeatures will have a geologicHistory comprising only one GeologicEvent, which represents the formation of the GeologicFeature.

*Figure 6 – UML class diagram: GeologicCollection*

A _GeologicCollection_ is a named or identifiable group of geological or geophysical objects. Geologic objects are commonly grouped into collections such as geological maps, thematic maps, groups of geophysical measurements or models of the same type etc, which are familiar to many user communities. The GeologicCollection class allows the delivery of a package of objects that go to make up one of these familiar collections.

*Figure 7 – UML class diagram: GeologicUnit*

_GeologicUnit_ represents a body of material in the Earth whose complete and precise extent is inferred to exist. Spatial properties are only available through association with a _MappedFeature_.

The _composition_ association from _GeologicUnit_ to _CompositionPart_ allows the lithological description of the Geologic Unit. The composition of a Geologic Unit can be made up of several Composition Parts, for example where there are lithologically distinct components interbedded.

*Figure 8 – UML class diagram: GeologicStructure*

_Geologic Structure_ is defined as a configuration of matter in the Earth based on describable inhomogeneity, pattern, or fracture in an Earth Material. The identity of a Geologic Structure is independent of the material that is the substrate for the structure.

The two types of GeologicStructure in the data model are ShearDisplacementStructure and Fold.

* _ShearDisplacementStructure_ includes all brittle to ductile style structures along which displacement has occurred, from a simple, single 'planar' brittle (fault) or ductile surface to a fault system comprised of tens of strands of both brittle and ductile nature.

* _Fold_ describes one or more systematically curved layers, surfaces, or lines in a rock body. A fold denotes a structure formed by the deformation of a Geologic Feature to form a structure that may be described by the translation of an abstract line (the fold axis) along some curvilinear path (the fold profile).

*Figure 9 – UML class diagram: GeomorphologicFeature*

The abstract _GeomorphologicFeature_ class is a point, linear or areal landform or landscape. It is a natural or an anthropogenic surface feature and may be erosional, depositional or both. _GeomorphologicFeature_ has two subtypes: _NaturalGeomorphologicFeature_ and _AnthropogenicGeomorphologicFeature._

* _NaturalGeomorphologicFeature_ is a geomorphologic feature produced by natural dynamics.
* _AnthropogenicGeomorphologicFeature_ is a man-made geomorphologic feature on the earth's surface (including those in shallow water), having a characteristic shape and range in composition, composed of unconsolidated earthy, organic materials, artificial materials, or rock, that is the direct result of human manipulation or activities. It can be either constructional (e.g., artificial levee) or destructional (quarry), or both.

*Figure 10 – UML class diagram: Borehole*

_Borehole_ is a generalized class for any narrow shaft drilled in the ground, at any angle. The logElement association to MappedInterval allows the description of a borehole log as a collection of MappedIntervals, each off which can be specified by a GeologicUnit and have a geologicHistory (age). This allows the description of lithological or stratigraphical borehole logs. A MappedInterval is a special kind of Mapped Feature whose shape is a 1-D interval and which uses the spatial reference system (SRS) of the containing borehole.

A MappedInterval is therefore an interpretation of the observations (lithological, geophysical etc) made in the original log, and it is only such interpreted borehole logs which are in scope of the data specification. These interpretations can be in terms of lithostratigraphic units described in a stratigraphic lexicon and shown on a geological map, but they can be in terms of other types of unit such as a recognisable lithological unit correlated between boreholes. The data specification does not cover the original observations upon which the interpretation was made, but these can be delivered using the GeoSciML and the ISO 19156 Observations & Measurements standard.

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

The observation location is specified by its coordinates.

===== Modelling of object references

MappedFeature can be seen as a container for geometry whereas GeologicFeature is a container for properties. This enables a single 'real world' GeologicFeature to have multiple 'map' representations, for example at different scales or resolutions of map or as an element in a  3D model

==== Description

===== Narrative description and UML Overview

image::./media/image14.png[image,width=604,height=751, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 11 – UML class diagram: Overview of the Hydrogeology application schema*

The INSPIRE Hydrogeological data model identifies two basic elements: the *'rock' system* or aquifer system (invariable in time) containing hydrogeological units, classified as aquifers, aquitards and aquicludes and the *'groundwater' system* with groundwater bodies (variable in time). Hydrogeological objects (man-made and natural objects such as groundwater wells and springs) interact with these domains of the 'rock' system and the 'groundwater' system. The 'rock' system and the 'groundwater' system and the interaction between them create a hydrogeological system. The principal aim of the core model is to capture the main classes of these systems and to provide the logical links between them. The *'groundwater' system* is created by groundwater flow in aquifers of the *'rock' system*, which have the right porosity and permeability to conduct groundwater. The *'groundwater' system* has distinct groundwater flow properties and a distinct pressure regime and is confined by permeability, groundwater surface or other barriers in the subsurface.

The model provides the classes of the 'rock' system and the 'groundwater' system and the links between them and also the interaction of these systems with man-made facilities and natural features. Like the INSPIRE Geological model the Hydrogeological model represents a more static approach aimed at providing mainly information depicted onhydrogeological maps at a regional or national scale (1 : 50.000 or smaller).

NOTE 1 For provision of detailed measurements on the quality and chemical composition of groundwater and time series measurements of groundwater level within groundwater wells the use of the WaterML 2.0 specification is recommended.

*The Hydrogeology - 'Rock' system*

image::./media/image15.png[image,width=605,height=529, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 12 – UML class diagram: HydrogeologicalUnit, AquiferSystem, Aquifer, Aquitard, Aquiclude*

The 'Rock' system has 1 main class, _HydrogeologicalUnit,_ with a number of important subclasses. _HydrogeologicalUnit_ is a part of the lithosphere with distinctive parameters for water storage and conduction, and is a specialisation of _GeologicUnit._

There are four important subclasses of _HydrogeologicalUnit_: _Aquifer_, _Aquitard, Aquiclude and AquiferSystem_. An _Aquifer_ is a wet underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, silt, or clay) from which groundwater can be usefully extracted by a groundwater well.

An _Aquitard_ is a saturated, but poorly permeable bed that impedes groundwater movement and does not yield water freely to wells, but which may transmit appreciable water to or from adjacent aquifers and, where sufficiently thick, may constitute an important groundwater storage unit.

An _Aquiclude_ is a _HydrogeologicalUnit_ that due to its low permeability can act as a barrier to groundwater flow and as such often confines aquifers or aquifer systems.

An _AquiferSystem_ is a collection of Aquifers and/or Aquitards which together constitute the environment of groundwater - "communicating vessels" that are filled or can be filled with groundwater i.e. a GroundWaterBody.

An _AquiferSystem_ may contain one or more _Aquifers, Aquitards_ and _Aquicludes_ .

*The hydrogeology – "Groundwater system"*

image::./media/image16.png[image,width=604,height=314, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 13 – UML class diagram: GroundWaterBody, AquiferSystem, ActiveWell, WFDGroundWaterBody - from the application schema Water Framework Directive of Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units INSPIRE theme*

The hydrogeological system is formed by the interaction of the groundwater system and the rock system.

The main class of the the groundwater system is _GroundWaterBody._

A _GroundWaterBody_ is a distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or system of aquifers, which is hydraulically isolated from nearby groundwater bodies. The _piezometricState_ property of a _GroundWaterBody,_ which specifies the piezometric state of the groundwater body water table, is modelled in a separate class _PiezometricState._

_WFDGroundWaterBody_ is a distinct volume of groundwater within a groundwater flow system, which is used as a reporting or management unit within the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This class is a special type of __ManagementOrRegulationZon__e class, which is imported from the application schema Water Framework Directive of Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units INSPIRE theme. The relationship to the GroundWaterBody is modeled through the association relatedGroundWaterBody (i.e. every _WFDGroundWaterBody_ is linked to 1 or many natural _GroundWaterBodies_).

_GroundWaterBody_ interacts with the 'rock' system through an association with _AquiferSystem._

*Hydrogeological objects*

image::./media/image17.png[image,width=604,height=549, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 14 – UML class diagram: HydrogeologicalObject, HydrogeologicalObjectNatural, HydrogeologicalObjectManMade, ActiveWell, GroundWaterBody, Borehole (from Geology), EnvironmentalMonitoringFacilities (from EF Theme)*

_HydrogeologicalObject_ is an abstract class for man-made or natural objects where interaction occurs with the hydrogeological system. _HydrogeologicalObject_ has two subclasses _HydrogeologicalObjectManMade and HydrogeologicalObjectNatural_

_HydrogeologicalObjectManMade_ is an abstract class for a manmade facility, where interaction occurs with the hydrogeological system.

An _ActiveWell_ is the only type of _HydrogeologicalObjectManMade_ defined in this application schema. It is an excavation or opening into the ground where the intended use is for location, acquisition, development, or artificial recharge of ground water. The association from _ActiveWell_ to _Borehole_ allows the _ActiveWell_ to be associated with a particular Borehole. Where there is an associated _Borehole_ the geometry should be taken from _Borehole_ rather than from _HydrogeologicalObject_.

_ActiveWell_ has a bidirectional associations to a _GroundWaterBody_ to describe the interaction between these wells and a groundwater body.

_HydrogeologicalObjectNatural_ is the type of _HydrogeologicalObject_ for natural objects where interaction (inflow or outflow) occurs with the hydrogeological system.

Like _ActiveWell, HydrogeologicalObjectNatural_ has bidirectional associations to a _GroundWaterBody_ to describe the interaction between a type of natural hydrogeological object and a groundwater body.

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

The observation location is specified by its coordinates.

===== Modelling of object references

MappedFeature can be seen as a container for geometry whereas GeologicUnit (and thus HydrogeologicalUnit) is a container for properties. This enables a single 'real world' GeologicUnit to have multiple 'map' representations, for example at different scales or resolutions of map or as an element in a 3D model.

A GroundWaterBody may be monitored by an EnvironmentalMonitoringFacility comprising one or more ActiveWells acting as groundwater observation wells.

Based on the different assumptions established in Member States the delineation of a WFDGroundWaterBody, used for reporting under the Water Framework Directive, boundary can differ from the natural GroundWaterBody extent.The WFDGroundWaterBody is associated with one or more natural groundwater bodies.

==== Description

===== Narrative description and UML overview

image::./media/image18.png[image,width=604,height=327, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 15 – UML class diagram: Overview of the Geophysics application schema*

The Geophysical data model is designed to fulfill identified common requirements mainly related to spatial locations and essential metadata of geophysical measurements. The extended model (see Annex D) is to demonstrate the extensibility of the core model to address some more specific geophysical information and delivery of observation results.

Fundamental classes that are defined in this model are related to the well-known geophysical concepts measurement and survey:

* _GeophMeasurement_ is a generic spatial object type that models the field observation procedure with its location, spatial characteristics and related metadata. The related projectedGeometry is necessary when measurement setup is 3 dimensional, to define a 2D geometry for displaying purposes
* _Campaign_ is used to document geophysical surveys as measurement campaigns

Both are derived from SF_SpatialSamplingFeature that is a fundamental element of the ISO 19156 Observations and Measurements standard (O&M). Geophysical entities are always used for spatial sampling either by means of data acquisition (measurements) or data processing (models), therefore these are considered as sampling features. To encode the geophysical results of data acquisition and modeling procedures the O&M standard has to be used. At the minimum, in the Geophysics application schema, the sampling geometry (shape) shall always be provided. Recommendations and coding examples about the use of O&M, are provided in the .

*Geophysics - Campaign*

image::./media/image19.png[image,width=604,height=344, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 16 – UML class diagram: GeophObjectSet, Campaign*

_GeophObjectSet_ is a generic spatial object type, subclass of SF_SamplingFeature that models geophysical entity collections like campaigns, or projects.

Note: In many cases it is useful to link observation results to collections, rather than to individual geophysical objects (e.g. a gravity map can be associated with a gravity survey and not with a single station). For encoding the O&M standard has to be used. As a minimum the sampling geometry shall always be provided. Recommendations for the use of O&M, and coding examples are provided in the guidelines (please reference D2.9 document).

_Campaign_ is subtype of _GeophObjectSet_. Geophysical activity is usually organized into campaigns and projects. In the core model Campaign is a collective class to document such measuring activities. In the extension model (see Annex D) another _GeophObjectSet_ subtype, _Project_ is also available.

*Geophysics - Measurement*

image::./media/image20.png[image,width=604,height=442, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 17 – UML class diagram: GeophObject, GeophMeasurment, GeophStation, GeophProfile, GeophSwath*

_GeophObject_ is a generic spatial object type that models single geophysical entities. It has two subtypes: _GeophMeasurement_ and _GeophModel._ The later is only available in the Geopysics extension application schema (see Annex D).

_GeophMeasurement_ is a generic spatial object type that models the field observation procedure with its location, spatial characteristics and related metadata. In contrast to Geophysical models geophysical measurements collect data outside or on the boundary of the observed spatial domain. In many cases observed data carries the characteristics of the internal organization of the observed domain as a function of some non spatial dimension (time, frequency, electrode distance etc.). It is a matter of processing to transform measured data so that the results overlap with the internal area of the observed domain. The observed property of a measurement is usually a geophysical property that can not be directly interpreted as a property of the observed domain.

In this model _GeophMeasurement_ has three subtypes: _GeophStation, GeophProfile_, and _GeophSwath._

_GeophStations_ are measurements spatially referenced to a point. They are used to collect data at a single location. The source – sensor setup may be elongated or two dimensional, but the observed data is either zero dimensional or a function of a non spatial parameter, for example time, frequency or electrode spacing. Processed results can be one dimensional (eg. a sounding curve) but it does not change the fact that the original sampling feature geometry is still a point. The type of _GeophStation_ is restricted to gravity and magnetic base stations, seismological stations, vertical electric soundings and magnetotelluric soundings.

Note: Exclusion of ordinary (non base) gravity and magnetic survey stations prevents data providers from the obligation of reporting millions of ordinary stations. These should be reported in a collective manner by using the _Campaign_ class.

Constraint: shape must be point geometry. It is equivalent to the center or reference point of the measurement.

__GeophProfile__s are measurements spatially referenced to a curve. They are used to collect data along a curve or a series of points that can either be on the surface or in the 3D space. Observed data is a curve coverage. Range data may contain non dimensional parameters, for example time, frequency. Processed results can be two dimensional (eg. a depth section) but it does not change the fact that the original sampling feature geometry is still a curve. The type of _GeophProfile_ is restricted to seismicLine, and boreholeLogging.

Constraint: shape must be curve geometry. It is equivalent to the reference curve of the measurement.

_GeophSwath_ is a geophysical measurement spatially referenced to a surface. Range data may contain non dimensional parameters, for example time, frequency. Processed results are two or three dimensional. Type of _GeophSwath_ is restricted to 3DSeismics.

Constraint: shape must be surface geometry. It is equivalent to the reference surface of the measurement.

===== Consistency between spatial data sets

===== Identifier management

All geophysical spatial object types shall be identified by an inspireId of type Identifier. It is composed of a local identification code, a namespace that identifies the naming authority, and an optional version number. Features derived from _GeophMeasurement_ usually don't get updated, and for this reason version number is not required. Features derived from _GeophModel_ may have several versions as a result of reprocessing. Therefore, version number may be required.

===== Modelling of object references

Using geophysical features object referencing is often required. (eg. largerWork, relatedMeasurement, relatedModel) For internal referencing the Identifier class of the General Concept Model is used. For external referencing the usage of MD_Identifier embedded in citation records is recommended.

== Reference systems, units of measure and grids

=== Default reference systems, units of measure and grid

The reference systems, units of measure and geographic grid systems included in this sub-section are the defaults to be used for all INSPIRE data sets, unless theme-specific exceptions and/or additional requirements are defined in section 6.2.

==== Coordinate reference systems

===== Datum

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.2_
*Datum for three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems*

For the three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems and the horizontal component of compound coordinate reference systems used for making spatial data sets available, the datum shall be the datum of the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) in areas within its geographical scope, or the datum of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) or other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with ITRS in areas that are outside the geographical scope of ETRS89. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of the ITRS and there is a well documented relationship between both systems, according to EN ISO 19111.

====

===== Coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.3_
*Coordinate Reference Systems*

Spatial data sets shall be made available using at least one of the coordinate reference systems specified in sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, unless one of the conditions specified in section 1.3.4 holds.

*1.3.1. Three-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.

* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.


*1.3.2. Two-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

. For the vertical component, one of the following coordinate reference systems shall be used:
--

* For the vertical component on land, the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) shall be used to express gravity-related heights within its geographical scope. Other vertical reference systems related to the Earth gravity field shall be used to express gravity-related heights in areas that are outside the geographical scope of EVRS.

* For the vertical component in the free atmosphere, barometric pressure, converted to height using ISO 2533:1975 International Standard Atmosphere, or other linear or parametric reference systems shall be used. Where other parametric reference systems are used, these shall be described in an accessible reference using EN ISO 19111-2:2012.

* For the vertical component in marine areas where there is an appreciable tidal range (tidal waters), the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) shall be used as the reference surface.

* For the vertical component in marine areas without an appreciable tidal range, in open oceans and effectively in waters that are deeper than 200 meters, the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or a well-defined reference level close to the MSL shall be used as the reference surface.

*1.3.4. Other Coordinate Reference Systems*

Exceptions, where other coordinate reference systems than those listed in 1.3.1, 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 may be used, are:
. Other coordinate reference systems may be specified for specific spatial data themes.

.  For regions outside of continental Europe, Member States may define suitable coordinate reference systems.

The geodetic codes and parameters needed to describe these other coordinate reference systems and to allow conversion and transformation operations shall be documented and an identifier shall be created in a coordinate systems register established and operated by the Commission, according to EN ISO 19111 and ISO 19127.
The Commission shall be assisted by the INSPIRE Commission expert group in the maintenance and update of the coordinate systems register.

====

===== Display

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.4_
*Coordinate Reference Systems used in the View Network Service*

For the display of spatial data sets with the view network service as specified in Regulation No 976/2009, at least the coordinate reference systems for two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude) shall be available.

====

===== Identifiers for coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.5_
*Coordinate Reference System Identifiers*

. Coordinate reference system parameters and identifiers shall be managed in one or several common registers for coordinate reference systems.

. Only identifiers contained in a common register shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems listed in this Section.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to use the http URIs provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium as coordinate reference system identifiers (see identifiers for the default CRSs in the INSPIRE coordinate reference systems register). These are based on and redirect to the definition in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry (_http://www.epsg-registry.org/_).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 2*

The identifiers listed in the INSPIRE coordinate reference systems register (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/crs) shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems used in a data set.

====

NOTE CRS identifiers may be used e.g. in:

* data encoding,
* data set and service metadata, and
* requests to INSPIRE network services.

==== Temporal reference system

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 11_
*Temporal Reference Systems*

. The default temporal reference system referred to in point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (footnote:[OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12.]) shall be used, unless other temporal reference systems are specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE 1 Point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (the INSPIRE Metadata IRs) states that the default reference system shall be the Gregorian calendar, with dates expressed in accordance with ISO 8601.

NOTE 2 ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. The standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears first in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It also provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information across time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

EXAMPLE 1997 (the year 1997), 1997-07-16 (16^th^ July 1997), 1997-07-16T19:20:3001:00 (16^th^ July 1997, 19h 20' 30'', time zone: UTC1)

==== Units of measure

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_
*Other Requirements & Rules*

(...)

[arabic, start=2]
. All measurement values shall be expressed using SI units or non-SI units accepted for use with the International System of Units, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

==== Grids

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 2.2_
*Grids*

Either of the grids with fixed and unambiguously defined locations defined in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 shall be used as a geo-referencing framework to make gridded data available in INSPIRE, unless one of the following conditions holds:

. Other grids may be specified for specific spatial data themes in Annexes II-IV. In this case, data exchanged using such a theme-specific grid shall use standards in which the grid definition is either included with the data, or linked by reference.

. For grid referencing in regions outside of continental Europe Member States may define their own grid based on a geodetic coordinate reference system compliant with ITRS and a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, following the same principles as laid down for the grid specified in Section 2.2.1. In this case, an identifier for the coordinate reference system shall be created.

*2.2 Equal Area Grid*

The grid is based on the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (ETRS89-LAEA) coordinate reference system with the centre of the projection at the point 52^o^ N, 10^o^ E and false easting: x~0~ = 4321000 m, false northing: y~0~ = 3210000 m.

The origin of the grid coincides with the false origin of the ETRS89-LAEA coordinate reference system (x=0, y=0).

Grid points of grids based on ETRS89-LAEA shall coincide with grid points of the grid.

The grid is hierarchical, with resolutions of 1m, 10m, 100m, 1000m, 10000m and 100000m.

The grid orientation is south-north, west-east.

The grid is designated as Grid_ETRS89-LAEA. For identification of an individual resolution level the cell size in metres is appended.

For the unambiguous referencing and identification of a grid cell, the cell code composed of the size of the cell and the coordinates of the lower left cell corner in ETRS89-LAEA shall be used. The cell size shall be denoted in metres ("m") for cell sizes up to 100m or kilometres ("km") for cell sizes of 1000m and above. Values for northing and easting shall be divided by 10^n^, where _n_ is the number of trailing zeros in the cell size value.

=== Theme-specific requirements and recommendations

There are no theme-specific requirements or recommendations on reference systems and grids.

<<<
== Data quality

This chapter includes a description of the data quality elements and sub-elements as well as the corresponding data quality measures that should be used to evaluate and document data quality for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Geology_ (section 7.1).

It may also define requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Geology_ (sections 7.2).

In particular, the data quality elements, sub-elements and measures specified in section 7.1 should be used for

* evaluating and documenting data quality properties and constraints of spatial objects, where such properties or constraints are defined as part of the application schema(s) (see section 5);
* evaluating and documenting data quality metadata elements of spatial data sets (see section 8); and/or
* specifying requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Geology_ (see sections 7.2).

The descriptions of the elements and measures are based on Annex D of ISO/DIS 19157 Geographic information – Data quality.

=== Data quality elements

Table 3 lists all data quality elements and sub-elements that are being used in this specification. Data quality information can be evaluated at level of spatial object, spatial object type, dataset or dataset series. The level at which the evaluation is performed is given in the "Evaluation Scope" column.

The measures to be used for each of the listed data quality sub-elements are defined in the following sub-sections.

[.text-center]
*Table 3 – Data quality elements used in the spatial data theme _Geology_*

|7.1.2 |Logical consistency |Domain consistency |adherence of values to the value domains |spatial object type; spatial object
|===

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 7*

Where it is impossible to express the evaluation of a data quality element in a quantitative way, the evaluation of the element should be expressed with a textual statement as a data quality descriptive result.

====

==== Logical consistency – Conceptual consistency

The Application Schema conformance class of the Abstract Test Suite in Annex I defines a number of tests to evaluate the conceptual consistency (tests A.1.1-A.1.7) of a data set.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 8*

For the tests on conceptual consistency, it is recommended to use the _Logical consistency – Conceptual consistency_ data quality sub-element and the measure _Number of items not compliant with the rules of the conceptual schema_ as specified in the table below.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 9*

For the tests on domain consistency, it is recommended to use the _Logical consistency – Domain consistency_ data quality sub-element and the measure _Number of items not in conformance with their value domain_ as specified in the table below.

=== Minimum data quality requirements

No minimum data quality requirements are defined for the spatial data theme _Geology_.

<<<
== Dataset-level metadata

This section specifies dataset-level metadata elements, which should be used for documenting metadata for a complete dataset or dataset series.

NOTE Metadata can also be reported for each individual spatial object (spatial object-level metadata). Spatial object-level metadata is fully described in the application schema(s) (section 5).

For some dataset-level metadata elements, in particular those for reporting data quality and maintenance, a more specific scope can be specified. This allows the definition of metadata at sub-dataset level, e.g. separately for each spatial object type (see instructions for the relevant metadata element).

=== Metadata elements defined in INSPIRE Metadata Regulation

Table 4 gives an overview of the metadata elements specified in Regulation 1205/2008/EC (implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata).

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to the relevant section in the Metadata Regulation, which contains a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.
* The fourth column specifies the condition, under which the given element becomes mandatory.

Generic guidelines for implementing these elements using ISO 19115 and 19119 are available at _http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101_. The following sections describe additional theme-specific recommendations and requirements for implementing these elements.

==== Conformity

The _Conformity_ metadata element defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC requires to report the conformance with the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services. In addition, it may be used also to document the conformance to another specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 10*

Dataset metadata should include a statement on the overall conformance of the dataset with this data specification (i.e. conformance with all requirements).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 11*

The _Conformity_ metadata element should be used to document conformance with this data specification (as a whole), with a specific conformance class defined in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A and/or with another specification.

====

The _Conformity_ element includes two sub-elements, the _Specification_ (a citation of the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services or other specification), and the _Degree_ of conformity. The _Degree_ can be _Conformant_ (if the dataset is fully conformant with the cited specification), _Not Conformant_ (if the dataset does not conform to the cited specification) or _Not Evaluated_ (if the conformance has not been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 12*

If a dataset is not yet conformant with all requirements of this data specification, it is recommended to include information on the conformance with the individual conformance classes specified in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 13*

If a dataset is produced or transformed according to an external specification that includes specific quality assurance procedures, the conformity with this specification should be documented using the _Conformity_ metadata element.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 14*

If minimum data quality recommendations are defined then the statement on the conformity with these requirements should be included using the _Conformity_ metadata element and referring to the relevant data quality conformance class in the Abstract Test Suite.

====

NOTE Currently no minimum data quality requirements are included in the IRs. The recommendation above should be included as a requirement in the IRs if minimum data quality requirements are defined at some point in the future.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 15*

When documenting conformance with this data specification or one of the conformance classes defined in the Abstract Test Suite, the _Specification_ sub-element should be given using the http URI identifier of the conformance class or using a citation including the following elements:

* title: "INSPIRE Data Specification on _Geology_ – Draft Guidelines – <name of the conformance class>"
* date:
** dateType: publication
** date: 2013-02-04

==== Lineage

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 16*

Following the ISO/DIS 19157 Quality principles, if a data provider has a procedure for the quality management of their spatial data sets then the appropriate data quality elements and measures defined in ISO/DIS 19157 should be used to evaluate and report (in the metadata) the results. If not, the _Lineage_ metadata element (defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC) should be used to describe the overall quality of a spatial data set.

====

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, lineage "is a statement on process history and/or overall quality of the spatial data set. Where appropriate it may include a statement whether the data set has been validated or quality assured, whether it is the official version (if multiple versions exist), and whether it has legal validity. The value domain of this metadata element is free text".

The Metadata Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119 specifies that the statement sub-element of LI_Lineage (EN ISO 19115) should be used to implement the lineage metadata element.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 17*

To describe the transformation steps and related source data, it is recommended to use the following sub-elements of LI_Lineage:

* For the description of the transformation process of the local to the common INSPIRE data structures, the LI_ProcessStep sub-element should be used.

* For the description of the source data the LI_Source sub-element should be used.

====

NOTE 1 In order to improve the interoperability, domain templates and instructions for using these free text elements (descriptive statements) may be specified here and/or in an Annex of this data specification.

*TWG Recommendations on the use of the Lineage MD element (based on the results of the OneGeology-Europe project):*

To provide the user with valuable information about the quality (thematic, geometric) and usability of geological map data, the metadata should include information about the original data sources (geological and topographic sources, digitizing and mapping processes) for the final digital dataset.

Geological units and structures are the result of an interpretation and their geometry is drawn on a topographic map. The digitizing method and the topographic map used are then very important for the data quality. To create all geological maps of a country needs several decades of work. So the data are very heterogeneous for many reasons, and harmonizing these data is a well-known issue and needs a huge work, but the user would like to know if the thematic and the geometric harmonisation are done or not.

*Metadata elements to describe the dataset*

* Internal thematic harmonization
* Internal geometric harmonization

*Metadata elements to describe Geological and Topographic Sources:*

* Title
* Description

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, at least one of the following temporal reference metadata sub-elements shall be provided: temporal extent, date of publication, date of last revision, date of creation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 18*

It is recommended that at least the date of the last revision of a spatial data set should be reported using the _Date of last revision_ metadata sub-element.

=== Metadata elements for interoperability

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 13_
*Metadata required for Interoperability*

The metadata describing a spatial data set shall include the following metadata elements required for interoperability:

. Coordinate Reference System: Description of the coordinate reference system(s) used in the data set.

. Temporal Reference System: Description of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.

. Encoding: Description of the computer language construct(s) specifying the representation of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device or transmission channel.

. Topological Consistency: Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the data set as described by the scope.
+
This element is mandatory only if the data set includes types from the Generic Network Model and does not assure centreline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for the network.

. Character Encoding: The character encoding used in the data set.
+
This element is mandatory only if an encoding is used that is not based on UTF-8.

. Spatial Representation Type: The method used to spatially represent geographic information.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to implement the required metadata elements based on ISO 19115 and ISO/TS 19139.

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with the proposed encoding.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 3*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the used ISO 19139 XML schema.

====

NOTE Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 4*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall contain the elements and meet the INSPIRE multiplicity specified in the sections below.

====

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 5*

The elements specified below shall be available in the specified ISO/TS 19139 path.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 19*

The metadata elements for interoperability should be made available together with the metadata elements defined in the Metadata Regulation through an INSPIRE discovery service.

====

NOTE While this not explicitly required by any of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, making all metadata of a data set available together and through one service simplifies implementation and usability.

==== Metadata elements for reporting data quality

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 22*

For reporting the results of the data quality evaluation, the data quality elements, sub-elements and (for quantitative evaluation) measures defined in chapter 7 should be used.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 23*

The metadata elements specified in the following sections should be used to report the results of the data quality evaluation. At least the information included in the row "Implementation instructions" should be provided.

====

The first section applies to reporting quantitative results (using the element DQ_QuantitativeResult), while the second section applies to reporting non-quantitative results (using the element DQ_DescriptiveResult).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 24*

If a dataset does not pass the tests of the Application schema conformance class (defined in Annex A), the results of each test should be reported using one of the options described in sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2.

====

NOTE 1 If using non-quantitative description, the results of several tests do not have to be reported separately, but may be combined into one descriptive statement.

NOTE 2 The sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2 may need to be updated once the XML schemas for ISO 19157 have been finalised.

The scope for reporting may be different from the scope for evaluating data quality (see section 7). If data quality is reported at the data set or spatial object type level, the results are usually derived or aggregated.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 25*

The scope element (of type DQ_Scope) of the DQ_DataQuality subtype should be used to encode the reporting scope.

Only the following values should be used for the level element of DQ_Scope: Series, Dataset, featureType.

If the level is featureType the levelDescription/MDScopeDescription/features element (of type Set< GF_FeatureType>) shall be used to list the feature type names.

====

NOTE In the level element of DQ_Scope, the value featureType is used to denote spatial object type.

== Delivery

=== Updates

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 8_
*Updates*

. Member States shall make available updates of data on a regular basis.

. All updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set, unless a different period is specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE In this data specification, no exception is specified, so all updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set.

=== Delivery medium

According to Article 11(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for INSPIRE spatial data sets and services. The relevant network service types for making spatial data available are:

* _view services_ making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;
* _download services_, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;
* _transformation services_, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability.

NOTE For the relevant requirements and recommendations for network services, see the relevant Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelinesfootnote:[The Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines on INSPIRE Network Services are available at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/5].

EXAMPLE 1 Through the Get Spatial Objects function, a download service can either download a pre-defined data set or pre-defined part of a data set (non-direct access download service), or give direct access to the spatial objects contained in the data set, and download selections of spatial objects based upon a query (direct access download service). To execute such a request, some of the following information might be required:

* the list of spatial object types and/or predefined data sets that are offered by the download service (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation),
* and the query capabilities section advertising the types of predicates that may be used to form a query expression (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation, where applicable),
* a description of spatial object types offered by a download service instance (to be provided through the Describe Spatial Object Types operation).

EXAMPLE 2 Through the Transform function, a transformation service carries out data content transformations from native data forms to the INSPIRE-compliant form and vice versa. If this operation is directly called by an application to transform source data (e.g. obtained through a download service) that is not yet conformant with this data specification, the following parameters are required:

Input data (mandatory). The data set to be transformed.

* Source model (mandatory, if cannot be determined from the input data). The model in which the input data is provided.
* Target model (mandatory). The model in which the results are expected.
* Model mapping (mandatory, unless a default exists). Detailed description of how the transformation is to be carried out.

=== Encodings

The IRs contain the following two requirements for the encoding to be used to make data available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 7_
*Encoding*

. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall conform to EN ISO 19118. In particular, it shall specify schema conversion rules for all spatial object types and all attributes and association roles and the output data structure used.

. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall be made available.

====

NOTE ISO 19118:2011 specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules used for interchange of geographic data within the set of International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". An encoding rule allows geographic information defined by application schemas and standardized schemas to be coded into a system-independent data structure suitable for transport and storage. The encoding rule specifies the types of data being coded and the syntax, structure and coding schemes used in the resulting data structure. Specifically, ISO 19118:2011 includes

* requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas,
* requirements for creating encoding services, and
* requirements for XML-based encoding rules for neutral interchange of data.

While the IRs do not oblige the usage of a specific encoding, these Technical Guidelines propose to make data related to the spatial data theme _Geology_ available at least in the default encoding(s) specified in section 0. In this section, a number of TG requirements are listed that need to be met in order to be conformant with the default encoding(s).

The proposed default encoding(s) meet the requirements in Article 7 of the IRs, i.e. they are conformant with ISO 19118 and (since they are included in this specification) publicly available.

==== Default Encoding(s)

===== Specific requirements for GML encoding

This data specification proposes the use of GML as the default encoding, as recommended in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of [DS-D2.7]. GML is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118, as required in Article 7(1). For details, see [ISO 19136], and in particular Annex E (UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules).

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with GML encodings.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 6*

Data instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the provided XML schema.

====

NOTE 1 Not all constraints defined in the application schemas can be mapped to XML. Therefore, the following requirement is necessary.

NOTE 2 The obligation to use only the allowed code list values specified for attributes and most of the constraints defined in the application schemas cannot be mapped to the XML sch. They can therefore not be enforced through schema validation. It may be possible to express some of these constraints using other schema or rule languages (e.g. Schematron), in order to enable automatic validation.

===== Default encoding(s) for application schema Geology

*Name: Geology GML Application Schema*
Version: version 3.0,

==== Recommended Encoding(s)

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 26*

It is recommended that also the encodings specified in this section be provided for the relevant application schemas.

====

===== The use of GeoSciML encoding 

*Name: GeoSciML*
Version: 3.2, GML, version 3.2.1
Specification: http://www.geosciml.org
Character set: UTF-8

GeoSciML v 3.2 is the community developed exchange format for providing detailed geoscientific information. It also served as the basis for the more simplified INSPIRE _Geology_ core data model. The detailed guidelines, entitled "GeoSciML 3.2 Encoding Cookbook for INSPIRE WFS services" document how to use GeoSciML for INSPIRE and are available at__:__

http://www.geosciml.org/geosciml/3.2/documentation/cookbook/INSPIRE_GeoSciML_Cookbook%20_1.0.pdf__.__

*_NOTE These aim at providing a unique encoding solution (e.g. a transformation tool) to fully address both INSPIRE and GeoSciML requirements. However, this proposed solution still needs to be tested by the wider stakeholder community as part of the INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation Framework. Based on the results, it should be discussed whether the current default INSPIRE encoding (see Section 9.3.1. ) can be replaced by the GeoSciML encoding._*

=== Options for delivering coverage data

For coverages, different encodings may be used for the domain and the range of the coverage. There are several options for packaging the domain and range encoding when delivering coverage data through a download service, as discussed belowfootnote:[Further details and examples will be included in a future version of the Guidelines for the encoding of spatial data [DS-D2.7].].

*Multipart representation*

For performance reasons, binary file formats are usually preferred to text-based formats such as XML for storing large amounts of coverage data. However, they cannot directly constitute an alternative to pure GML, since their own data structure might often not support all the ISO 19123 elements used to describe coverages in the conceptual model.

The OGC standard GML Application Schema for coverages [OGC 09-146r2] offers a format encoding which combines these two approaches. The first part consists of a GML document representing all coverage components except the range set, which is contained in the second part in some other encoding format such as 'well known' binary formats'. Some information in the second part may be redundant with the GML content of the first part. In this case, consistency must be necessarily ensured, for example by defining a GML mapping of the additional encoding format.

The advantage of this multipart representation is that coverage constituents are not handled individually but as a whole. This is not really the case with GML which also allows the encoding of the value side of the coverage in external binary files, but via references to remote locations.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 7*

Coverage data encoded as multipart messages shall comply with the multipart representation conformance class defined in GML Application Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2].

====

NOTE The GML Application Schema for Coverages establishes a one-to-one relationship between coverages and multipart document instances.

*Reference to an external file*

The range set can be encoded within the XML structure as an external binary file using the gml:File element. This has the benefit of efficiently storing the range set data within an external file that is of a well-known format type, for example TIFF or GeoTIFF. This method of encoding is of most use for the storage of large files.

*Encoding the range inline*

This option encodes the range set data within the XML inline. This is encoded as a DataBlock element. This encoding provides much greater visibility for the range set values, however, this comes at the cost of reduced efficiency. This method of encoding would therefore only be suitable for small datasets.

*Encoding the domain inside a JPEG 2000 file*

This option consists in packaging all the components of one or several coverages, including the domain expressed in GML, in a single JPEG 2000 file. It is based on the OGC standard GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery [OGC 05-047r2], also known as GMLJP2, which specifies how to use GML within the XML boxes of JPEG 2000 files.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 8*

Coverage data encoded in standalone JPEG 2000 files shall comply with the OGC standard GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery [OGC 05-047r2].

====

TG Requirement 8 implies that all the encoding rules presented in GMLJP2 shall be strictly followed for including GML within JPEG 2000 data files correctly. For the sake of harmonization, the encoding rules adopted for the multipart message encoding should also apply to the GMLJP2 encoding.

The encoding of coverage components in GMLJP2 within a JPEG 2000 file should conform to the rules specified in the Guidelines for the encoding of spatial data [DS-D2.7].

== Data Capture

There is no specific guidance required with respect to data capture.

<<<
== Portrayal

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for this theme. Portrayal is regulated in Article 14 of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

. For the portrayal of spatial data sets using a view network service as specified in Commission Regulation No 976/2009 (footnote:[OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9.]), the following shall be available:
[loweralpha]
.. the layers specified in Annex II for the theme or themes the data set is related to;
.. for each layer at least a default portrayal style, with as a minimum an associated title and a unique identifier.

[arabic, start=2]
. For each layer, Annex II defines the following:
[loweralpha]
.. a human readable title of the layer to be used for display in user interface;
.. the spatial object type(s), or sub-set thereof, that constitute(s) the content of the layer.

====

In section , the _types_ of layers are defined that are to be used for the portrayal of the spatial object types defined in this specification. A view service may offer several layers of the same type, one for each dataset that it offers data on a specific topic.

NOTE The layer specification in the IRs only contains the name, a human readable title and the (subset(s) of) spatial object type(s), that constitute(s) the content of the layer. In addition, these Technical Guidelines suggest keywords for describing the layer.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 27*

It is recommended to use the keywords specified in section  in the _Layers Metadata parameters_ of the INSPIRE View service (see Annex III, Part A, section 2.2.4 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009).

====

Section 0 specifies one style for each of these layers. It is proposed that INSPIRE view services support this style as the default style required by Article 14(1b).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 9*

For each layer specified in this section, the styles defined in section 0 shall be available.

====

NOTE The default style should be used for portrayal by the view network service if no user-defined style is specified in a portrayal request for a specific layer.

In section 11.3, further styles can be specified that represent examples of styles typically used in a thematic domain. It is recommended that also these styles should be supported by INSPIRE view services, where applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 28*

In addition, it is recommended that, where applicable, INSPIRE view services also support the styles defined in section 11.3.

====

Where XML fragments are used in the following sections, the following namespace prefixes apply:

* sld="http://www.opengis.net/sld" (WMS/SLD 1.1)
* se="http://www.opengis.net/se" (SE 1.1)

=== Styles recommended to be supported by INSPIRE view services 

The way rock units are portrayed on maps is an important factor in facilitating the understanding of geological data and can be used to highlight, for example, the different lithologies or ages. For the user it is important to be able to recognise patterns and schemes, so that relevant information can be drawn from the spatial data base immediately.

A portrayal scheme for lithology, age and faults was developed for OneGeology-Europe with special attention paid to the particularities of the different European countries.

[appendix]
== Abstract Test Suite - (normative) 

*Disclaimer*

While this Annex refers to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services, it does not replace the legal act or any part of it.


The objective of the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) included in this Annex is to help the conformance testing process. It includes a set of tests to be applied on a data set to evaluate whether it fulfils the requirements included in this data specification and the corresponding parts of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010 (implementing rule as regards interoperability of spatial datasets and services, further referred to as ISDSS Regulation). This is to help data providers in declaring the conformity of a data set to the "degree of conformity, with implementing rules adopted under Article 7(1) of Directive 2007/2/EC", which is required to be provided in the data set metadata according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2008/1205 (the Metadata Regulation).

*Part 1* of this ATS includes tests that provide *input for assessing conformity with the ISDSS regulation.* In order to make visible which requirements are addressed by a specific test, references to the corresponding articles of the legal act are given. The way how the cited requirements apply to ge specification is described under the testing method.

In addition to the requirements included in ISDSS Regulation this Technical guideline contains TG requirements too. TG requirements are technical provisions that need to be fulfilled in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement when the specific technical implementation proposed in this document is used. Such requirements relate for example to the default encoding described in section 9. *Part 2* of the ATS presents tests necessary for assessing the *conformity with TG requirements*.

NOTE Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in this ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

The *ATS is applicable to the data sets that* *have been transformed* to be made available through INSPIRE download services (i.e. the data returned as a response to the mandatory "Get Spatial Dataset" operation) rather than the original "source" data sets.

The requirements to be tested are grouped in several _conformance classes_. Each of these classes covers a specific aspect: one conformance class contains tests reflecting the requirements on the application schema, another on the reference systems, etc. *Each conformance class is identified by a URI* (uniform resource identifier) according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ge/<conformance class identifier>

EXAMPLE 1 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ef/rs_ identifies the Reference Systems ISDSS conformance class of the Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF) data theme.

The results of the tests should be published referring to the relevant conformance class (using its URI).

When an INSPIRE data specification contains *more than one application schema,* the requirements tested in a conformance class may differ depending on the application schema used as a target for the transformation of the data set. This will always be the case for the application schema conformance class. However, also other conformance classes could have different requirements for different application schemas. In such cases, a separate conformance class is defined for each application schema, and they are distinguished by specific URIs according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ge/<conformance class identifier>/ 
<application schema namespace prefix>

EXAMPLE 2 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/el/as/el-vec_ identifies the conformity with the application schema (_as_) conformance class for the Elevation Vector Elements (_el-vec_) application schema.

An overview of the conformance classes and the associated tests is given in the table below.

|===

In order to be conformant to a conformance class, a data set has to pass *all* tests defined for that conformance class.

In order to be conformant with the ISDSS regulation the inspected data set needs to be conformant to *all* conformance classes in Part 1. The conformance class for overall conformity with the ISDSS regulation is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ge/._

In order to be conformant with the Technical Guidelines, the dataset under inspection needs to be conformant to all conformance classes included both in Part 1 and 2. Chapter 8 describes in detail how to publish the result of testing regarding overall conformity and conformity with the conformance classes as metadata. The conformance class for overall conformity with the Technical Guidelines is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/tg/ge/3.0._

It should be noted that data providers are not obliged to integrate / decompose the original structure of the source data sets when they deliver them for INSPIRE. It means that a conformant dataset can contain less or more spatial object / data types than specified in the ISDSS Regulation.

*A dataset that contains less spatial object and/or data types* can be regarded conformant when the corresponding types of the source datasets after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation.

A *dataset that contain more spatial object and/or data types* may be regarded as conformant when

* all the spatial object / data types that have corresponding types in the source dataset after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation and
* all additional elements of the source model (spatial object types, data types, attributes, constraints, code lists and enumerations together with their values) do not conflict with any rule defined in the interoperability target specifications defined for any theme within INSPIRE.

====
*Open issue 1*: Even though the last condition can be derived from Art. 8(4) of the Directive, the ISDSS Regulation does not contain requirements concerning the above issue. Therefore, no specific tests have been included in this abstract suite for testing conformity of extended application schemas. Annex F of the Generic Conceptual Model (D2.5) provides an example how to extend INSPIRE application schemas in a compliant way.
====

The ATS contains a detailed list of abstract tests. It should be noted that some tests in the Application schema conformance class can be automated by utilising xml *schema validation tools.* It should be noted that failing such validation test does not necessary reflect non-compliance to the application schema; it may be the results of erroneous encoding.

Each test in this suite follows the same structure:

* Requirement: citation from the legal texts (ISDSS requirements) or the Technical Guidelines (TG requirements);
* Purpose: definition of the scope of the test;
* Reference: link to any material that may be useful during the test;
* Test method: description of the testing procedure.

According to ISO 19105:2000 all tests in this ATS are basic tests. Therefore, this statement is not repeated each time.

== Part 1 - (normative)

*Conformity with Commission Regulation No 1089/2010*

=== Application Schema Conformance Class

*Conformance class:*

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ge/as/Geology

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ge/as/Hydrogeology

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ge/as/Geophysics

==== Schema element denomination test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether each element of the dataset under inspection carries a name specified in the target application schema(s).

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Art. 3 and Art.4 of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

c) [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether the corresponding elements of the source schema (spatial object types, data types, attributes, association roles, code lists, and enumerations) are mapped to the target schema with the correct designation of mnemonic names.

NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Value type test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether all attributes or association roles use the corresponding value types specified in the application schema(s).

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4, Art.6(1), Art.6(4), Art.6(5) and Art.9(1)of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

c) [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether the value type of each provided attribute or association role adheres to the corresponding value type specified in the target specification.

NOTE 1 This test comprises testing the value types of INSPIRE identifiers, the value types of attributes and association roles that should be taken from enumeration and code lists, and the coverage domains.

NOTE 2 Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Value test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether all attributes or association roles whose value type is a code list or enumeration take the values set out therein.

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Art.4 (3) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

c) [.underline]#Test Method#: When an attribute / association role has an enumeration or code list as its type, compare the values of each instance with those provided in the application schema. To pass this tests any instance of an attribute / association role

* shall not take any other value than defined in the enumeration table when its type is an enumeration.

* shall take only values explicitly specified in the code list when the code list's extensibility is "none".

* shall take only a value explicitly specified in the code list or shall take a value that is narrower (i.e. more specific) than those explicitly specified in the application schema when the code list's extensibility is "narrower".

NOTE 1 This test is not applicable to code lists with extensibility "open" or "any".

NOTE 2 When a data provider only uses code lists with narrower (more specific values) this test can be fully performed based on internal information.

NOTE 3 All code lists defined in this Data specification on _Geology_ are with the extensibility "open" or "any". Before using a new or more detailed term the definitions of all values of a relevant code list should be checked (see Recommendation 4).

==== Attributes/associations completeness test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether each instance of spatial object type and data types include all attributes and association roles as defined in the target application schema.

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4(1), Art.4(2), and Art.5(2) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

c) [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine whether all attributes and association roles defined for a spatial object type or data type are present for each instance in the dataset.

NOTE 1 Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

NOTE 2 For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided if it exists in or applies to the real world entity – either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ If the characteristic described by the attribute or association role does not exist in or apply to the real world entity, the attribute or association role does not need to be present in the data set.

==== Abstract spatial object test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the dataset does NOT contain abstract spatial object / data types defined in the target application schema(s).

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Art.5(3) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

c) [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine that there are NO instances of abstract spatial object / data types in the dataset provided.

NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Constraints test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the instances of spatial object and/or data types provided in the dataset adhere to the constraints specified in the target application schema(s).

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Art. 3, Art.4(1), and Art.4(2) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

c) [.underline]#Test Method#: Examine all instances of data for the constraints specified for the corresponding spatial object / data type. Each instance shall adhere to all constraints specified in the target application schema(s).

NOTE Further technical information is in the Feature catalogue and UML diagram of the application schema(s) in section 5.2.

==== Geometry representation test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verification whether the value domain of spatial properties is restricted as specified in the Commission Regulation No 1089/2010.

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Art.12(1) of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

c) Test Method: Check whether all spatial properties only use 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometric objects that exist in the right 2-, 3- or 4-dimensional coordinate space, and where all curve interpolations respect the rules specified in the reference documents.

NOTE Further technical information is in OGC Simple Feature spatial schema v1.2.1 [06-103r4].

=== Reference Systems Conformance Class

*Conformance class:*

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ge/rs

==== Datum test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether each instance of a spatial object type is given with reference to one of the (geodetic) datums specified in the target specification.

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Annex II Section 1.2 of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010

c) [.underline]#Test Method#: Check whether each instance of a spatial object type specified in the application schema(s) in section 5 has been expressed using:

* the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) within its geographical scope; or
* the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) for areas beyond the ETRS89 geographical scope; or
* other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with the ITRS. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of ITRS and there is a well-established and described relationship between both systems, according to the EN ISO 19111.

NOTE Further technical information is given in Section 6 of this document.

==== Coordinate reference system test

a) [.underline]#Purpose#: Verify whether the two- and three-dimensional coordinate reference systems are used as defined in section 6.

b) [.underline]#Reference#: Section 6 of Commission Regulation 1089/2010.

c) [.underline]#Test Method#: Inspect whether the horizontal and vertical components of coordinates one of the corresponding coordinate reference system has been:

* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.

* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

* Two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system.

* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate reference system.

== Use case - (informative) 

This annex describes the use cases related to Geology, Hydrogeology & Geophysics that were used as a basis for the development of this data specification. Geological information is mainly collected or produced to be used by other thematic domains (geo-hazard assessment, ensuring safe disposal of wastes, providing construction material etc.) as described in the document "Examples of use".

The following use cases are described:

*UC01: Providing geological data to detect geo-hazards*

*UC02: Providing geological data to ensure safe disposal of waste*

*UC03: Providing geological data to detect ground instability in a flat area*

*UC04: Looking for deep fractured zones in the basement (Geothermal exploration)*

*UC05: Checking background radiation level changes*

*UC06: Providing data to undertake water balance to ensure compliance with the WFD*

*UC07: Groundwater reporting for WFD*

*UC08: Providing hydrogeological data to define significant pressure*

*UC09: Providing data to assess Corrosivity to Underground Assets*

*UC10: Providing data to plan tunneling operations safely and effectively*

=== UC01: Providing geological data to detect geo-hazards

This use case is related to example of use:

* GE-02: Detecting geo-hazards.

*Overview and involved actors*

This use case is a part of a more general use case which provides risk maps in a process that involves many other data than geological data (like meteorological data, elements at risk, ...) in the disaster management cycle.

The goal of this use case is therefore to deliver geological data to the engineer responsible for establishing risk maps.

Actors:

* Geological surveys to provide geological information (Geological Surveys represent the Member States)
* Engineers responsible for establishing risk maps using the geological information in combination with other data.

*Narrative description*

The hazard is often defined as the probability of occurrence of a potentially damaging phenomenon within a given area and a given period of time. To define this probability the engineer has to access data describing the physical, chemical, mechanical properties of rocks.

*Requirements from the use case*

Analyzing the use case, there is a need to provide the following objects and attributes:

Geological units with:

* their related polygons
* lithology

Geologic structures (faults) with:

* their related lines
* attribute: active or non-active

Borehole data with:

* geologic unit thickness and depth
* water level
* any other properties (physical and chemical) measured

Geotechnical data with:

* data related to the geologic units (from measurements: porosity, ...)
* or values related to the rock types in general

*Relationship with other INSPIRE Themes*

This use case has some relationships with the following INSPIRE data themes:

* Soils: the geotechnical properties are those of the rocks but also of the soil on a "continuous column".
* Natural Risk Zones: Geology is a provider of information about underground to engineers who has to define the risk zones.

=== UC02: Providing geological data to ensure safe disposal of waste

This use case is related to example of use:

* GE-03: Ensuring the safe disposal of wastes, Nuclear Waste, Carbon Capture and Storage.

*Overview and involved actors*

This use case is a part of a more general use case which provides geological data in a process that involves many other data than geological data (like population distribution, land use ...) in the waste disposal management cycle. It is relevant for the disposal of many different kinds of waste in various geological environments. The goal of the use case is to deliver geological data to the authorities and companies responsible for safe disposal of waste.

Actors:

* Geological surveys to provide geological data (Geological Surveys represent the Member States)
* Authorities and companies responsible for safe disposal of waste using the geological data in combination with other data.

*Narrative description*

"Safe disposal" usually means that the waste is placed in the bedrock or in unconsolidated superficial deposits at some depth (< 2 500 meters) below the surface. Depending on the nature of the waste the actual site of disposal is either in a natural space (e.g. pore space) or in man-made space (e.g. excavation or bore hole). Examples of waste are burned nuclear fuel and carbon dioxide. Geological data is needed to build a 3D-model that is used and refined during all stages of the waste disposal process: site selection, planning, characterization, construction, and follow-up program.

=== UC03: Providing geological data to detect ground instability in a flat area

This use case is related to example of use:

* GE-02: Detecting geo-hazards.

*Overview and involved actors*

This use case is a very particular case which provides risk maps in a process that involves many other data than geological data (like use of the subsurface data, elements at risk...) in the land and urban management cycle.

The goal of this use case is to deliver geological data to the responsible for land and urban planning. These data should then be merged with other related data, in order to construct a basic framework which allows classifying areas according to its hazard and risk levels. From this, further specific works, at the scale of the project, should be developed.

Actors:

* Geological surveys to provide geological information, including hazard assessment, if available (Geological Surveys represent the Member States)
* Mining Authorities to provide information on active and abandoned underground activities
* Geological Surveys and/or Water Authorities to provide information on groundwater
* Responsible for establishing risk maps using the geological information in combination with other data.
* Land and urban planners

*Narrative description*

Land and urban planning need to know the ground stability for safe infrastructure development.

In flat areas, ground instabilities are mainly related to:

* The existence of soluble lithologies in the subsurface (i.e. evaporites: gypsum or salt; carbonates...)
* The existence of sand and gravel deposits, loess, peat, shrinking and swelling clays, and other unconsolidated materials, including artificial landfills.
* The variations in the water table (natural and induced by artificial activities)
* The existence of a (melting) permafrost
* The presence of mining, gas production, subsurface infrastructures and other anthropic underground structures, both active and abandoned
* The seismic activity

Some surface features, as are dolines, some kind of depressions, or other landforms, can be indications of ground instability.

The three first groups of data (lithologies, unconsolidated deposits and hydrogeological data) and the surface features indicating ground instability (geomorphological elements) are geological data and the rest are related data.

(The hazard is often defined as the probability of occurrence of a potentially damaging phenomenon within a given area and a given period of time. To define this probability the engineer has to access data describing the physical, chemical, mechanical properties of rocks).

*Requirements from the use case*

Analyzing the use case, there is a need to provide the following objects and attributes:

*Geophysical Survey:*

* geometry, geophysical method type (airborne geophysics), list of measured physical parameters (total gamma radiation)
* distribution metadata

*Geophysical features*

From the use case there is a request for three main types of geophysical features. These are:

* *Geophysical measurement*
* *Geophysical model*
* *Geophysical survey*

*Geophysical measurement*

Geophysical measurements are artifacts to study the spatial distribution of physical properties within the observed domain, most often underground geologic structures. Usually measured data itself can not be used directly in geological interpretation. It has to be analyzed by experts to create geophysical models. The availability and location of geophysical measurements, especially those collected in hydrocarbon, geothermal exploration or environmental studies are considered as information of public interest in most member states.

*Geophysical model*

Geophysical models are results of data processing. They represent spatial distribution of physical properties within the observed domain, typically underground geologic structures. Geophysical models can be used directly for geologic interpretation. Results are distributed either in industry standard format or as GML coverage.

*Geophysical survey*

Geophysical exploration surveys may include large number of measurements over large areas. The individual measurements may not be important for the user, but the existence, type, and availability of their results are essential.

*Relationship with other INSPIRE Themes*

This use case has some relationships with the following INSPIRE data themes:

* Human health – for identifying areas with different level of hazard caused by increased background radiation intensity
* Natural risk zones – to register hazardous areas with increased background radiation intensity

=== UC06: Providing data to undertake water balance to ensure compliance with the WFD

This use case is related to example of use:

* AQ-01: Water supply (water abstraction).

*Overview and involved actors*

The goal of this use case is therefore to deliver hydrogeological data to professionals responsible for establishing whether groundwater bodies are over or under abstracted according to the WFD. Examples of the professionals include regulators such as the Environment Agency of England and Wales.

Actors:

* Geological surveys to provide geological information (Geological Surveys represent the Member States)
* Other hydrometric organizations to provide relevant hydrological data, e.g. rainfall
* Professionals responsible for ensuring compliance with the WFD, e.g. regulator in each member state.
* Professionals responsible for establishing water supply system, for local government to support water management decision process as well as individual investors.
* Water modelers.

*Narrative description*

The WFD requires that a groundwater body has "good status" in that it is not over abstracted. In order to ensure that a groundwater body is not over abstracted, then a water balance needs to be undertaken. The various inputs and outputs to the system need to be quantified and the balance calculated. Importantly the proportion of abstraction compared to recharge to the aquifer has to be determined. The water balance is created for an Assessment Point (AP) for each sub-catchment.

Groundwater Unit is an object in GWML in relation to Geologic Unit in GeoSciML. Although to describe aquifer the more precise information is expected. The GWML object structure may be use as pointed at figure bellow (pink). Those object allow to define type aquifer water table (confined, unconfined).

=== UC07: Groundwater reporting for WFD

This use case is related to example of use:

* AQ-05: Groundwater quality and quantity assessment.

*Overview and involved actors*

The implementation of the WFD requires the handling of spatial data both for the preparation of the River Basin Management Plans and for the reporting to the Commission.

Article 15 of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires Member States to provide information to the European Commission concerning the river basin management plans (RBMP). The RBMP covers, among others a general description of the characteristics of the river basin district (RBD) required under Article 5 and Annex II WFD including the mapping of the location and boundaries of groundwater bodies (GWB) (Annex VII, WFD).

Recommendation for the form and scope of spatial information deliver under the WFD and the Groundwater Directive (GWD) were presented in "Updated Guidance on Implementing the Geographical Information System (GIS) Elements of the EU Water policy".

Member States are obliged to deliver necessary data to fulfill Water Information System of Europe (WISE) managed by European Environmental Agency (EEA).

Actors:

* Geological surveys to provide geological information (Geological Surveys represent the Member States)
* Member States Environmental Agencies or other bodies responsible for reporting
* European Environmental Agencies (EEA)

*Narrative description*

GWBs according to Article 2.12 WFD are defined as "a distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or aquifers". Thus GWBs are three-dimensional. For the time being it is not possible to represent WBs three-dimensionally in geographic information systems as there are, in most cases, not enough data available to develop three-dimensional models of GWBs. Thus the representation of the feature will be as two-dimensional polygons.

The spatial data concerning GWB is a basis for general maps produce:

• Map 1: Quantitative status – Identification of bodies that are at "good quantitative status" and those that are at "poor quantitative status";

• Map 2: Achievement/exceedance of standard for nitrates (value in Annex 1 of GWD or set according to paragraph 3 of Annex 1 GWD, and according to status assessment procedure in Article 4 of GWD);

• Map 3: Achievement/exceedance of standard for pesticides (combined total and individual value in Annex 1 of GWD or set according to paragraph 3 of Annex 1 GWD, and according to status assessment procedure in Article 4 of GWD); 
• Map 4: Achievement/exceedance of threshold values set by Member States for other pollutants (considering in this category the list of substances as contained in Part B of Annex II of GWD and more generally any other pollutants contributing to the characterisation of groundwater bodies as being 'at risk', and according to status assessment procedure in Article 4 of GWD);
• Map 5: Trends - Identification of: (a) groundwater bodies with environmentally significant and sustained upward trends in pollutant concentrations, and (b) groundwater bodies in which trends have been reversed;

GIS data submitted by Member States will be also used to produce a *WISE Reference GIS dataset of groundwater bodies* by the EEA or its contracted partners.

GWBs provided by Member States will be merged into one dataset taking into account the description of the submitted GWBs (layered, depth range, aquifer type etc.) to produce a consistent dataset.

*Requirements from the use case*

Analyzing the use case, there is a need to provide the following objects and attributes:

The following data were requested as a minimum to be provided for each GWB (under Reporting sheet GWB1):

• Unique code;

• Name (if available);

• X co-ordinate (Longitude) of the centroid of the GWB;

• Y co-ordinate (Latitude) of the centroid of the GWB; and

• Size (surface area (m2), unique identifier for the horizon where separate overlying bodies

exist and, if possible, volume of aquifer (m3).

This was translated into the reporting schemas as follows:

image::./media/image52.png[image,width=605,height=363, align=center]


In addition to the IDs assigned by Member States (MS_CD), unique IDs will be generated at EC level (EU_CD) to uniquely identify groundwater bodies in the WISE Reference GIS dataset. This is necessary to identify and visualise *transboundary GWBs*. With the IDs assigned by Member States only the Member State part of transboundary GWBs can be identified.

The structure of the WISE code will be defined by the data provider of the reference dataset according to the specifications given in the WISE GIS guidance document, second edition. The data provider will be the EEA or its contracted partner.

The following diagram illustrates a fictive example of MS GWB-IDs and European (WISE) GWBIDs for a transboundary groundwater body.

image::./media/image53.png[image,width=290,height=199, align=center]

[.text-center]
*There is a transboundary GWB between AT and CZ. Both Member States delineate the national parts of the transboundary GWBs and assign IDs (EUGroundwaterBodyCode=ATGK1200087,CZ195). The boundaries of the GWB are harmonised at the country border and the GWBs are marked as transboundary. At EU level it will be identified which Member State parts of transboundary GWBs belong together and unique IDs for the total GWB will be assigned (ECGWB173).*

To develop a more consistent picture of groundwater bodies it will be necessary to get information on aquifer types and the 3-dimensional characteristics of GWBs, as they might overlay each other.

GIS data to be reported for each groundwater body are specified in Guidance Document: Guidance for reporting under the Water Framework Directive (see Chapter 13). This data will allow the description and visualisation of GWBs and groups of GWBs. Furthermore the parameter horizon should also be characterised according to the groundwater body layer (e.g. alluvial deposit layer, "main" layer, deep horizon (cenoman), thermal or mineral water).

The definition of the parameter "*horizon*", which will be used in the sense of the numerical position of groundwater body layer (e.g. 1 for the first horizon from the surface, 2 for the second horizon from the surface, 3 for the third horizon from the surface, 4 for fourth and deeper horizons from the surface).

The following attributes should be reported for each GWB

* Water body code
* Water body name
* Shape/GML file
** Groundwaters: boundaries of all groundwater bodies or groups of groundwater bodies identified.

* For groundwater bodies or groups of groundwater bodies, if available:
** Layered (Y/N)
** Average depth to groundwater body (m)
** Average thickness of groundwater body (m)
** Assignment to a depth range where the main part of the GWB is situated in (depth ranges: 0-20m, 20-50 m, 50-200 m, >200m)
** Directly dependent aquatic ecosysteRBD (Y/N)
** Directly dependent terrestrial ecosysteRBD (Y/N)
** Geological formation – aquifer type (according to a predefined typology)
** Type of vertical orientation of GWB (indicated by category and visualised by symbols)
** Volume of aquifer (m3) (if possible)

* Relevant point source discharges to groundwater
** ID of significant point sources where data already available
** Latitude and longitude of each relevant point source (if possible)
** Type of point source (see GWPI3)

* Relevant diffuse source pollution to groundwater bodies
** WB Affected? (Y/N)
** Type of source (see GWPI4)

* Relevant abstractions from groundwater
** WB Affected? (Y/N)
** Latitude and longitude of each abstraction (if possible)
** Type of abstraction (see GWPI5)

* Relevant artificial recharge of groundwater
** WB Affected? (Y/N)
** Type of Regulation/Alteration (see GWPI6)

* Significant saltwater or other intrusion
** WB Affected? (Y/N)

* Other pressures
** WB Affected? (Y/N)
** Type of Pressure (to be specified see GWPI8)

* Impacts
** Type of impact identified (see GWPI9)

* Protected areas
** Water body within or overlapping with a protected area (Y/N)
** Type of protected area (provide a shape file only where information is NOT reported under any other Directive. Where information has been provided under other Directives provide the unique identifier (code) of the appropriate protected area)

For WISE reporting it is expected that except the GroundWater bodies the Groundwater monitoring station location will be required for reporting.

*Relationship with other INSPIRE Themes*

This use case has some relationships with the following INSPIRE data themes:

* Hydrography (HY): GWB is a subset of Water Body class which is the main element in WFD directive reporting as well as base information for Water Management Plans analyzes (water balance)..
* Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units (AM): there is a important relation between GWB and water related reporting units
* Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF): location and characteristics of Groundwater monitoring facilities will be provided by EF specification, but the link to GW monitoring measurement method and properties is needed in _Geology_ DS

The goal of this use case is therefore to deliver hydrogeological data to professionals responsible for biological diversity

Actors:

*Narrative description*

Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) are a diverse and important component of biological diversity. The term GDE takes into account ecosystems that use groundwater as part of survival, and can potentially include wetlands, vegetation, mound springs, river base flows, cave ecosystems, playa lakes and saline discharges, springs, mangroves, river pools, billabongs and hanging swamps. The groundwater dependence of ecosystems will range from complete reliance to those that partially rely on groundwater, such as during droughts. The degree and nature of dependency will influence the extent to which ecosystems are affected by changes to the groundwater system, both in quality and quantity. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires those terrestrial ecosystems dependent on groundwater be identified and the anthropogenic pressures acting on the ecosystems analysed.

* level - for unconfined aquifers, the depth below surface of the water table;
* pressure - for confined aquifers, the potentiometric head of the aquifer and its expression in groundwater discharge areas;
* quality - the chemical quality of groundwater expressed in terms of pH, salinity and/or other potential constituents, including nutrients and contaminants.

*Relationship with other INSPIRE Themes*

This use case has some relationships with the following INSPIRE data themes:

* Bio-geographical Regions, Habitats and Biotopes, Species Distribution (BR, HB, SD): existence of some ecosystems in strong plant and animal communities relations with groundwater system.

*Overview and involved actors*

The goal of this use case is therefore to deliver hydrogeological and geochemical data to professionals responsible for operating underground assets such as water pipes and building foundations to establish whether corrosion will occur and degrade the asset sufficient to cause a leakage, etc.

Actors:

*Narrative description*

Underground assets, such as iron pipes, concrete foundations are at risk from corrosion due to chemical attack from solutes found in groundwater and leached from the rock they are in contact with. To provide an understanding of areas where the potential for corrosion is greatest, then the relevant data need to be brought together and an assessment undertaken of the potential for corrosion. By combining hydrogeologcial and geochemical data then the likelihood of corrosion occurring to the underground asset can be quantified and maps produced to inform operators of these assets to be informed.

The goal of this use case is therefore to deliver hydrogeological data to professionals responsible for tunneling operations.

Actors:

* Geological surveys to provide geological information (Geological Surveys represent the Member States)
* Other organizations to provide relevant hydrogoelogical data, e.g. groundwater level.
* Professionals responsible for planning and undertaking tunneling operations.
* {blank}

*Narrative description*

Tunneling is an activity that required suitable knowledge of the geological and hydrogeological conditions to be undertaken safely and cost effectively. Knowledge of the ground conditions that are likely to be encountered is very important to ensure that the correct tunnel boring techniques are used and that the operations are conducted in a safe a way as possible. Understanding of the saturation of the deposits being tunnelled through is equally important to ensure the safe undertaking of underground working. Therefore, building a 3D understanding of the geology combined with the variation of groundwater heads is important in planning any tunneling operation.

*Requirements from the use case*

Analyzing the use case, there is a need to provide the following objects and attributes:

Topographic data:

* DTM

Geological data:

* borehole logs
* 2D maps
* previously created cross sections
* physical and mechanical properties of geological units
* rock mass classification

Hydrogeological units with:

* their related polygons
* water table depth
* rock lithology

Unsaturated zone data:

* moisture content

*Relationship with other INSPIRE Themes*

This use case has some relationships with the following INSPIRE data themes:

* Soils: moisture content:
* Elevation: DTM
* Geology: the geologic property of an aquifer

To understand water movement around any underground structure, it is important to quantify groundwater flow, therefore data for groundwater quantity need to be available.

The majority of groundwater measurements are undertaken at a well, therefore the WaterWell feature type needs to be included.

The most common species of algae found on algal flats are blue-green algae of the genera Scytonema and Schizothrix. These algae can tolerate the daily extremes in temperature and oxygen that typify conditions on the flats. Other plants sometimes found on algal flats include one-celled green algae, flagellates, diatoms, bacteria, and isolated scrubby red and black mangroves, as well as patches of saltwort. Animals include false cerith, cerion snails, fiddler crabs, and great land crabs.

!Name: !salt water
!Definition: !Saline water is a general term for water that contains a significant concentration of dissolved salts (NaCl). The concentration is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm) of salt. The salinity concentration level used by United States Geological Survey classifies saline water in three categories. Slightly saline water contains around 1,000 to 3,000 ppm. Moderately saline water contains roughly 3,000 to 10,000 ppm. Highly saline water has around 10,000 to 35,000 ppm of salt. Seawater has a salinity of roughly 35,000 ppm, equivalent to 35 g/L. Technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 to 30 grams of salt per litre?more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand (ppt). Thus, brackish covers a range of salinity regimes and is not considered a precisely defined condition. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water

[appendix]
== Data model extensions - (informative) 

=== Introduction

The INSPIRE _Geology_ and Geophysics models are both simple and designed to enable harmonised INSPIRE services. However for many use cases a wider range of more detailed geoscientific information might be required.

=== Use of GeoSciML

GeoSciML is a model for the exchange of detailed geoscience information which has been developed by the international geosciences community, in particular Geological Survey Organisations (_http://www.geosciml.org/_). GeoSciML version 3.1 was the starting point in developing the INSPIRE GE model and has heavily influenced its design. However GeoSciML has much broader scope than is required for INSPIRE so the INSPIRE GE model has been developed through a simplification of the required parts of GeoSciML, while aiming to retain the same overall design pattern and key features. Therefore mapping between the INSPIRE GE model and GeoSciML currently in version 3.2 is possible. The detailed mapping between both models is described in the document: *"GeoSciML 3.2 Encoding Cookbook for INSPIRE WFS services"* that is be available at:

http://www.geosciml.org/geosciml/3.2/documentation/cookbook/INSPIRE_GeoSciML_Cookbook%20_1.0.pdf.

=== Data model extension for Geophysics

==== _Narrative description and UML overview_

The core application schema is limited to successfully serve the complex use cases. When the request for data provisioning exceeds the limits of the _Geophysics_ application schema the extension model can be used. It allows data providers to publish many types of geophysical measurements and results with sufficient detail to fulfil the user requirements documented in the use cases. The most significant difference between the core and extension models is that the extension model introduces additional elements to share observation results in a harmonized way. This is done through the ISO 19156 Observations and Measurements (O&M) standard and specialized observation classes from the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model. For the sake of simplicity the _GeophysicsExtension_ application schema defines only a few additional observation classes that are specific to geophysical measurements and models. It is mainly left to the data provider to decide how the standard is used. However by providing controlled dictionaries and best practice examples the guidance tries to help in achieving maximum level of interoperability.

[discrete]
===== Spatial object Type - Project

The extension model provides an additional class to model geophysical _Projects_. Together with the _Campaign_ class of the core model these two can be used for a more detailed description of the geophysical dataset hierarchy. In practice geophysical surveys are often organised into campaigns and projects. A large exploration project may contain several campaigns. e.g.: A big project is started with an airborne measurement campaign. After identifying the main target area a seismic campaign with several seismic lines is carried out. Meanwhile in certain areas where expensive seismic is not feasible magnetotelluric measurements are completed. Each campaign is carried out by different companies, and produce different maps, reports and datasets. The whole activity is controlled by one responsible party, the principal investigator. To model such complex hierarchies the core _Campaign_ and the extension _Project_ feature types can be used.

image::./media/image54.png[image,width=623,height=346, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 18 – UML class diagram: Project*

Campaign is geophysical activity extending over a limited time range and limited area for producing geophysical measurements, processing results or models. Campaigns can be considered as parents of geophysical measurements or models. Children geophysical objects may refer to their parent campaign through the largerWork attribute.

_Project_ is geophysical activity extending over a longer time period and larger area, containing any number of campaigns or subprojects. In the hierarchy of geophysical data sets projects are parents of geophysical campaigns, and usually cover whole exploration programs. _Project_ has one added voidable attributes:

* principalInvestigator: Key party responsible for conducting research

In many cases it is useful to link observation results to collections, rather than to individual geophysical objects. (e.g. a gravity map can be associated with a gravity survey and not with a single station) Both Campaign and Project are subtypes of SF_SpatialSamplingFeature, so it can be done by using the O&M standard. While it sounds quite natural to link observations to _Campaigns_, it is not very likely that any kind of observation is going to be linked to a _Project_. Even in this case at least a shape for bounding geometry shall be provided.

[discrete]
===== GenericGeophMeasurement

The list of geophysical methods in the _GeopysicsCore_ application schema is very limited. This class was added to _GeophysicsExtension_ as a generic container for geophysical methods that do not fit in the core measurement types (station, profile, swath). This class adds one attribute to the supertype _GeophMeasurement_

* measurementType: Value must be one of the items listed in the _OtherMeasurementTypeValue_ codelist. This codellist is expected to be extended in the future.

image::./media/image55.png[image,width=320,height=373, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 19 – UML class diagram: GenericGeophMeasurement*

Publishing observation data related to a geophysical measurement is optional in INSPIRE. The _GeophObject_ class has the _distributionInfo_ attribute that holds metadata about data access, ordering procedures, fees etc. When the data provider wants to share observation results in a more interoperable manner the use of _SF_SpatialSamplingFeature_ properties is recommended. Guidance to encode observations is given in chapter A.3.7

[discrete]
===== Models

In the _GeophysicsExtension_ application schema _GeophModel_ is a geophysical object that is created as a result of data processing or interpretation, representing the distribution of physical or geophysical properties within the observed spatial domain. This definition is broader than the usual concept of model in geophysics that is rather a mathematical construction, a replacement of the reality and it can be used for forward modeling. In INSPIRE under model a geophysical product is meant that can be useful not only for geophysicists, but also for specialists of other domains. It is somewhere at the end of the processing chain. Using O&M terminology the sampledFeature association of a _GeophModel_ always can be connected to one or more _GeophMeasurements_.

Apart from the ones inherited from _GeophObject GeophModel_ has one voidable attribute:

* relatedMeasurement: It can be used to identify related _GeophMeasurement_ instances.

Just like measurements, geophysical models are also categorized on the basis of sampling geometry. _CurveModel_ is a _GeophModel_ with curve geometry. Calculated property values are referenced to a curve. Typical examples are compositLog, layerModel, seismicTimeSection.

Note 1. A 1D layerModel is represented by the trajectory perpendicular to the layer boundaries. Layer parameters are referenced to the curve section overlapping the corresponding layer. The last section of the curve ends at the depth of penetration.

_CurveModel_ has one attribute:

* _modelType_: must be a value from the _CurveModelTypeValue_ codelist.

Constraint: shape must be _GM_Curve_

_SurfaceGridModel_ is a _GeophModel_ with surface geometry. Calculated property values are referenced to a series of grid points on the surface. Typical examples are seismicDepthSection or 2D resistivity section.

It has one attribute:

* _modelType_: must be a value from the _SurfaceGridModelTypeValue_ codelist.

Constraint: shape must be _GM_Surface_

_SolidGridModel_ is a _GeophModel_ with solid geometry. Calculated property values are referenced to a series of grid points in the solid. Typical examples are seismicVolume or 3D resistivity block.

It has one attribute:

* _modelType_: must be a value from the _SolidGridModelTypeValue_ codelist.

Constraint: shape must be _GM_Solid_

_OtherGeophModel_ is a _GeophModel_ with any geometry not listed above.

Examples: Interpreted resistivity cross section (discrete surface coverage that contains polygon patches with resistivity values assigned to them) or Gravity point source distribution (multipoint coverage).

It has one attribute:

* _modelType_: must be a value from the _OtherGeophModelTypeValue_ codelist.

===== How to decide between Measurement and Model?

In contrast to Geophysical measurements geophysical models represent spatial distribution of physical or geophysical properties within the observed spatial domain. Models are created by processing or interpretation and carry the characteristics of the investigated domain as a function of 1 2 or 3 spatial dimensions. It is a matter of data processing to convert measurement data from non spatial dimensions (time, frequency, electrode distance etc.) into space. As a result of this procedure the number of dimensionality increases by 1.

GeophMeasurement and GeophModel are the initial and final stage of the geophysical processing chain. However, the processing chain can be long and if the result originates from an intermediate step it is not always easy to decide which class it belongs to. Table 1. can help in the classification of a feature type.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|*GeophMeasurement* |*GeophModel*
|Data is spatially referenced outside or on the boundary of the investigated domain |Data is spatially referenced to the internal part of the investigated domain
|Observed data is a function of some non spatial domain (propagation time, frequency, etc.) to be transformed into space by processing |Observed data is a function of space (or space and time for monitoring.)
|Observed property is a geophysical property and not directly interpretable as property of the investigated domain. |Observed property is a property of the investigated domain.
|Result can not be used directly for interpretation |Result can be directly used for interpretation
|===

Examples:

* SeismicLine is GeophMeasurement (field data). Observed property is seismic amplitude as a function of time, It is not the property of the investigated domain and the data is not usable for direct interpretation.

* SeismicTimeSection is somewhere between measurement and model. It has one spatial and one non spatial domain (propagation time) to be converted into depth, but it carries information on the seismic reflectivity of the investigated domain and in practice it is often used directly for interpretation. So it is classified as a curve model.

* SeismicDepthSection is clearly a model: a 2D spatial coverage of seismic reflectivity that is directly usable for interpretation.

===== Observations Result and Procedure

In the O&M schema OM_Observation has four main associations: Phenomenon, Domain, Range, and ProcessUsed (*Figure 21*). Phenomenon connects to the observedProperty. Domain is the observed spatial domain with the featureOfInterest at the target end. Range means the result that was acquired while examining the target. These two relates to each other like domain and range of GML coverages.

image::./media/image57.png[image,width=451,height=361, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 21 – UML class diagram: Observations overview (GCM)*

Results contain observedProperty values characterising the featureOfInterest. ProcessUsed links to a procedure that was used to generate results. Type of result is "Any" since it may represent the value of any feature property. The procedure has the abstract OM_Process type with no properties and serves as a base class for observation processes. Using these concepts any type of observation can be fully described, and it is true for geophysical observations as well.

Geophysics has a rich history of describing observation processes and results, and strong industrial standards for data exchange. Many of the standards were developed long before O&M. However, most geophysical data resources can fit to the O&M concept and plugged into some of the above associations. The _GeophysicsExtension_ application schema does not provide a full scale model for geophysical objects. Instead, providing a few auxiliary classes it helps to use the O&M standard as a frame for geophysical information.

image::./media/image58.png[image,width=489,height=409, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 22 – UML class diagram: Result and Procedure*

In the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model OM_Process has a specialized subclass: Processes::Process. (*Figure 22*) It has the role of describing generic procedures that are common in practice and can be referenced from many observations that were made in the same or similar way. It has name, identifier, documentation, responsibleParty to inform the user about the nature of the procedure and the authority that maintains the record. ProcessParameters are names of important parameters that are characteristic to the procedure. A useful set of names is available in the hierarchical GeophProcessParameterNameValue codelist. In geophysical terminology process parameters can be considered as header parameters. An instance of Processes::Process contains only the names and descriptions. It is the parameter property of OM_Observation that holds the values and tell how a generic procedure was applied in a specific case. In order to assure consistency between the processParameters in the procedure and the parameters within OM_Observation, constraints should be applied.

Example: A generic process is 2D seismic data acquisition. Suitable processParameters in this case are sampling rate, sensor spacing, minimum offset, coverage, etc. An observation instance contains the values that give the user an idea about the most important conditions that influenced data production.

Codelist GeophProcessNameValue contains common names that can be used as the name attribute of Processes ::Process.

_GeophResult_ is a container class for geophysical result files. The INSPIRE recommendation for encoding observations is to use specialized observations with proper coverage types from the Generic Conceptual Model, if appropriate. For non coverage observations the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) schema can be used to encode results. Annex A contains several examples to demonstrate best practices and to help data providers to encode their results. Very often in geophysics data is provided in widely used industry standard format, and XML encoding is not an option. In such cases _GeophResult_ is used to include data resources in __GeophysicalObject__s. The class has one attribute:

* _geophResource_: Any number of geophResource items can be included in _GeophResult_.

_GeophResource_ has two attributes:

* _resource_: Data access is provided as CI_OnlineResource, a URL for online access, and an optional description about the resource.
* _resourceType_: Type must be one of the items in the _ResourceTypeValue_ codelist.

O&M data must contains physical and geophysical property names either as references to observed properties or embedded in the result. For such referencing items in the GeophPropertyNameValue codelist are recommended.

===== SF_SpatialSamplingFeature

Both _GeophObject_ and _GeophObjectSet_ are derived from SF_SpatialSamplingFeature. Direct observations do not exist in geophysics, it is always about sampling. Geophysical measurements are artefacts that are created with the only intention to realize sampling. The ultimate feature of interest is a part of the earth. The final outcome is a spatial distribution of some physical property of the observed domain, usually the result of a processing chain. Each processing step can be exactly modelled as a separate sampling feature with its' own observation, procedure, observed property and result. The output of one step is the input of the next one. In other words: the sampling feature of one step becomes the sampled feature of the next one. It means that geophysical models are also sampling features that realize sampling by mathematical procedures. The difficulty of modelling geophysical entities comes from the fact that the processing chain can be very long and the intermediate observations are often hidden or out of interest. Intermediate outputs are bundled with final results. Lots of ambiguities can be explained by this condition. As a compromise in INSPIRE the geophysical processing chain is cut into two parts. The first part is represented by GeophMeasurement, the second by GeophModel. The scope of measurement, model, and the differences are explained in chapter D.2.1. (How to decide between Measurement and Model?)

As a minimum, SF_SamplingFeature requires two properties: shape and sampledFeature. Shape is the geometry of the domain where the sampled values are referenced. SampledFeature can be any feature that is considered as the target of observation. An efficient way of binding geology and geophysics is to refer to one or more geological units. If no specific feature can be named, reference to a generic concept (e.g. _http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/2.2/realmGeol.owl#Lithosphere_ ) can be used. Data provisioning by the _GeophysicsCore_ application schema does not have to go any further in using O&M. An example samplingFeature representing a seismic line

===== OM_Observation

To be able to serve requirements identified in the use cases further elements provided by the O&M standard has to be used. Measurement details must be documented in one or more relatedObservation elements. Results originating from different processes must be separated in different observations. It is a matter of convention what is included in a process. A list of process types is available in the GeophProcessNameValue codelist. Example processes from the dictionary:

* _2DseismicDataAcquisition_
* _2DseismicProcessing_
* _airborneDataAcquisition_
* _boreholeLogging_
* _gravityProcessing_
* _inversion_
* _magneticObservation_
* _timeDomainEMSounding_
* _verticalElectricSounding_

Associated process parameter names and category values can be found in the GeophProcessParameterNameValue hierarchical codelist. Process parameter names and allowed category values are available as narrower terms of the appropriate elements.

Example: Following the GCM Observation schema definition a process descriptor file for 2DseismicDataAcquisition would look like this:

Referencing the generic process by the xlink:href attribute makes the code compact and more readable.

[source, xml]
<om:procedure xlink:href=" http://anyCompany/2DSeismicDataAcquisition.xml"/>

The series of <om:parameter> elements follow the definitions in the process descriptor. Category parameter values are taken from the narrower terms in the SKOS dictionary. E.g.: value of SRC_TYPE shall be one of \{vibrator, explosive, hammer, airgun}. Numeric values must be encoded as gml:Quantity elements completed with unit of measurement. For referencing Industry standard resource files the industryStandardResource parameter is used. The value of the parameter is a URL pointing to the resource itself. Seismic process descriptors like SPS and UKOOA files shall be accessed through this parameter. URL can be an entry point to a secure data service maintained by the data provider.

_Note: Hierarchical code list dictionaries were constructed from GEOMIND parameter catalogues, and cover only a few of the most important geophysical methods. These dictionaries were set up for demonstration purposes to support encoding of geophysical procedures in INSPIRE documents. A full coverage of all geophysical methods can't be the task of the INSPIRE data specification. The responsibility to improve the geophysical SKOS dictionaries will be passed to appointed organizations representing the geophysical community._

The OM_Observation instance contains important temporal information about the geophysical object, such as phenomenonTime, and resultTime. PhenomenonTime can be a time instant or a time range and refers to the time of the sampling activity. For a seismic line it is reasonable to use time range documenting the measurement start and measurement end. For a survey station measurement providing a time instant is appropriate. ResultTime rather means the time instant from when result is available.

[discrete]
===== observedProperty

Observations always focus on some property of the feature of interest. It is either a physical property of the ultimate feature of interest, or a more abstract geophysical property that is measured or simulated by the geophysical process. It can also be a composit property that is a group of properties measured together. The om:observedProperty element is used to include such information in the OM_Observation element. A list of geophysical properties is available at _http://geomind.elgi.hu/skos/GeophProperty.xml_. The ObservableProperty application schema in the GCM Observation package allows data providers to define complex properties with statistical measures and constraints like "total magnetic field average over 1 minute period derived from 1 second averages". Example:

[source, xml]
<omop:ObservableProperty gml:id="op1">
   <omop:basePhenomenon codeSpace="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/GeophPropertyNameValue/magneticProperty">MAG_T</omop:basePhenomenon>

               <omop:aggregationTimePeriod>PT1S</omop:aggregationTimePeriod>
            </omop:StatisticalMeasure>
         </omop:derivedFrom>
         <omop:statisticalFunction codeSpace="http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/2.0/mathStatistics.ow">Mean</omop:statisticalFunction>
         <omop:aggregationTimePeriod>PT1M</omop:aggregationTimePeriod>
      </omop:StatisticalMeasure>
   </omop:statisticalMeasure>
</omop:ObservableProperty>

[discrete]
===== featureOfInterest

The feature of interest (FOI) of a direct observation is the natural target that is observed (color of an apple – observedProperty is color, FOI is apple). When sampling is carried out the observations' feature of interest is the sampling feature itself. The proximate target of a seismic observation is the seismic line and not the earth. The observed property is the seismic amplitude measured on the geophones that are part of the seismic line. This is expressed by the xlink:href attribute that points back to the SF_SpatialSamplingFeature:

[source, xml]
<om:featureOfInterest xlink:href="../../.."/>

[discrete]
===== Result

There are several ways to include geophysical results in an OM_Observation instance. In the case of coverage observations, or when results are available in XML format, inline encoding or referencing directly from the om:result element is recommended. When results are provided in non XML industry standard format, or more result files are bundled together the GeophResult element shall be used. An example seismic field data result package may look like this (pseudo XML encoding):

[source, xml]
GeophResult
   geophResource
      resource
         linkage ”http://any.institution/getItem?id=asd-123.1.1.segy”

      resourceType " http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/ResourceTypeValue/seismicResource/SEG-Y "

[discrete]
===== Dividing data sets

When larger geophysical data sets extend over concession area boundaries, there may be a request to divide observation results into separate peaces. In such cases the use of SamplingFeatureComplex elements are recommended. Parts can be encoded in individual SF_SpatialSamplingFeature elements, and results are accessed at separate web locations with different distribution options. The main geophysical object contains the shape of the whole complex and the links to the related sampling features.

===== Using Coverages

In principle any geophysical observation result can be encoded as GML coverage. To achieve a higher level of interoperability the use of coverages is highly recommended in INSPIRE. At the same time GML and other XML based encodings are not very common in geophysics, and there are situations when it is neither practical nor possible. Though, there are several ways to efficiently bind XML and binary data, converting huge seismic data files is still not an option. In cases when data exchange is based on widely accepted international standards, the use of those standards must be supported. On the other hand, out of the hydrocarbon industry the weight of standards is not so high, in fact, the lack standards and the virulence of ad-hoc formats is typical. In such cases following the O&M standard and the coverage model is a good alternative for data exchange.

The recommendation of the INSPIRE Cross Thematic Working Group on Observations & Measurements is to use GCM specialized observations when it is possible [DS-D2.9]. The abundance of geophysical data types and the need of supporting industrial standards make the exclusive usage of coverage observations impossible. To avoid fragmentation of the data model a more generic approach seems to be more appropriate in the geophysical domain. However, in result encoding whenever it is feasible the coverage types recommended in the [DS-D2.9] document should be used. (RectifiedGridCoverage, ReferenceableGridCoverage, MultiPointCoverage, TImeSeries)

The GML coverage model supports all discrete coverage types to encode many geophysical data types (_http://www.opengis.net/gmlcov/1.0_ name space):

* MultiPointCoverage
* MultiCurveCoverage
* MultiSurfaceCoverage
* MultiSolidCoverage

It also provides coverage types for gridded geophysical data:

* RectifiedGridCoverage
* ReferenceableGridCoverage

The table below gives an overview of how results of different geophysical methods can be encoded in principle by the GML coverage model.

===== Encoding GeophStation results

It seems to be reasonable not to use different encoding on the basis of the number of points included in a data set. DomainSet of a MultiPointCoverage is one or more points. In this case a station is considered a multipoint object with one single member. (For single point data CV_DiscretePointCoverage could also be used). The following example shows the encoding of gravity station measurement:

===== Encoding LayerModels

Layer model is a generic concept for representing a 1D structure. An efficient way of encoding is to use MultiCurveCoverage. Typical use cases are delivering inversion results from VES, TDEM, or MT measurements. Composit logs or borehole data can also be encoded like this. Originally GeoSciML also uses CurveCoverage to describe boreholes. Curve segments of the multi curve domain coincide with the layers. For positions a 3D coordinate system is used. The following example shows a horizontally layered earth with vertical curve segments below the station location. Range data contains resistivity and chargeability values from the inversion of a VES/IP sounding station.

===== Encoding VerticalParameterGrid

The following example shows a resistivity cross section encoded as ReferenceableGridCoverage. Grid geometry is defined by node locations in a 3D coordinate system. The trace of the sample profile is a straight line in SW-NE direction. Nodes are located on the surface in a vertical plain. According to the rangeType element the coverage contains resistivity values for each node.

NOTE Referenceable grids can be used for nodes with uneven spacing or to project grid data to curved surfaces (e.g.: vertical section along a meandering profile)

In practice grid coverages may contain large amount of data. XML text encoding in such cases is not practical. The [DS-D2.9] document contains recommendations on "out-of band result encoding" explaining how to include optimized binary files in the rangeSet element.

===== Encoding GeophStation Data as SensorML

Intermediate results like measurement data often contain non spatial coordinates (frequency, pressure, electrode distance etc.) as domain set. In such cases coverage encoding is not applicable, instead SensorML can be used. The following example illustrates the encoding of Vertical Electric Sounding data as SensorML System:

NOTE In principle gml allows the definition of non spatial coordinate systems and so with proper CRS referencing frequency, pressure or instrumental time axis can also be used in coverages for encoding "location". This would also solve the problem of handling seismic time sections (SamplingCurve) and depth sections (SamplingSurface) in a different way that may seem weird for seismic experts. However, until such definitions are not available using SensorML is considered to be best practice.

=== Aquifers and Groundwater bodies

==== Introduction

Water has always been the basis for human existence. World water use in the past century grew twice as fast as world population. Groundwater has been described as "our Hidden Asset" and although this is a truism groundwater makes up about twenty percent of the world's fresh water supply. As far as "clean", drinking water resources are concerned it is much more. Groundwater is one of the most important components of water cycle in environment (Fig. 1).

[.text-center]
*Fig. 1 Summary of groundwater processes.*

The European Union has recognized the need for a consistent framework for legislation on water management. According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) introduced in 2000 water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which must be protected, defended and treated as such.

Hydrogeology describes the flow, condition of occurrence and behaviour of water in the underground environment. It is a science located between hydrology and geology, whilst it is necessary to have an understanding of both disciplines. Hydrological processes are responsible for the quantity of water supply e.g. as a result of aquifer recharge. On the other hand, the physical properties and composition of the geologic materials (rocks and sediments) create the main environment for groundwater flow and storage and rocks and sediments also influence groundwater quality as a result of their chemical composition.

Groundwater can be both a resource and a problem depending on what activity is being undertaken. A positive benefit is abstraction for drinking water supply, whereas groundwater flooding causes significant problems to properties and transport infrastructure. Hydrogeology has a direct influence on the environment; groundwater abstraction not only provides water for human consumption but also can cause changes in water flow direction and in some cases may have a dramatic impact on surface water bodies. Overexploitation in an area where groundwater dependent ecosystems are located may change the water table level or the chemical composition of water which may lead to irreversible changes in the ecosystems.

In terms of INSPIRE, the groundwater domain has many connections and dependencies on other human activities described in other themes (Area Management, Soil, Environmental Facilities, Energy Resources, Hydrography, Protected Sites, Utility and Governmental Services). Contamination introduced to groundwater systems takes years to decades to be cleaned out. Prediction is a problem but slow rates of flushing and low rates of degradation are significant issues.

This document intends to introduce groundwater issues to the members of the INSPIRE _Geology_ and Mineral Resources TWG.

==== Background to groundwater processes

One suitable source of background information for groundwater issues is the UK's groundwater forum website – _www.groundwateruk.org_. The section "Groundwater in Depth", see _www.groundwateruk.org/Groundwater-in-depth.aspx_, has some excellent articles on some of the issues introduced below.

Hydrogeology is a large and complex subject involving the appreciation of many aspects of groundwater, including flow, solute and heat transport, and multi-phase flow. The discipline also includes the study of the unique ecology that inhabits the sub-surface water environment. However, for the purposes of this document, a short summary of the most important aspect of groundwater is required.

Traditionally sub-surface flow of water has been defined as occurring in aquifers, which consist of permeable rocks through which water can flow. These aquifers can be separated by aquitards which are less permeable, or are not as good at passing water through them. In the extreme low permeability case, aquicludes are defined as geological strata which impede the flow of water. However, in the last decade, this definition has been seen as too simplistic and the concept of a groundwater system has been developed. This concept allows the study of the sub-surface water environment in a holistic way which better reflects the hydrological cycle.

Typically the approach to understanding a groundwater system is to determine the inflows, outflows and the movement of water through the system (see Fig. 2). For example the WHO defines a groundwater system as "a discrete, closed three-dimensional system containing flow paths from the point at which recharging water enters an aquifer to the topographically lower point at which it leaves the aquifer (WHO 2006)". Inflows to and outflows from the system can be effected by both natural and anthropogenic factors.

*Fig. 2 Example groundwater system showing inflows and outflows and time of travel of water through the system. (GWMate briefing note no. 2: Characterization of Groundwater Systems).*

Inflow: The majority of recharge occurs through the soil zone, especially in temperate countries, such as those in Europe. Recharge is defined as the amount of water leaving the soil zone that can eventually reach the groundwater table. Other ways water can be emplaced in the groundwater system include artificial recharge by injecting water into the aquifer via boreholes or surface ponds.

Outflow: There are a number of natural ways that water can leave a groundwater system. These include baseflow to rivers, springflow and outflow to the sea. The most obvious man made outflow to any groundwater system is pumped abstraction from a borehole.

The interaction between rivers and groundwater is complex; rivers can provide both inflow and outflow to the system (Fig. 3) and this can change with time depending on the relationship of the river stage and groundwater head locally. When the groundwater head is below the river stage then water can flow from the river to the aquifer beneath the river. When the flow in the river reduces and thus the stage, then the flow direction can be reversed and the groundwater system can provide an input to the river (Fig. 3). The contribution of groundwater to a river is normally termed "baseflow".

[.text-center]
*Fig. 3 Different types of river-aquifer interaction (GWMate briefing note no. 2: Characterization of Groundwater Systems).*

There are a number of different ways that groundwater can move through the sub-surface (Fig. 4): flow through porous media, flow through fractured aquifers and karstic flow. Flow through porous media is characterised by water moving through the gaps between the rock particles, often in unconsolidated deposits. Where water movement exploits cracks or fissures in the rock to move then this is termed fracture flow. In the extreme case large connected conduit or even "cave" systems can be developed and water movement through this system is termed karstic flow.

*Fig. 4 Different types of flow regimes in groundwater systems (www.goodquarry.com).*

Groundwater systems can be exploited for a number of uses: supply, including water for drinking, heat reservoir, repository for waste (solid and liquid), a store for excess water during the winter, to name but a few. Groundwater systems are used by humans in many ways and an understanding of the complex interaction between the natural system and the effects of human intervention needs to be developed, normally called conceptualisation.

Conceptualisation: collect data, develop an understanding of the groundwater system and formalise this understanding into a conceptual model, quantify processes including water balance and then create a model of the system. Attention needs to be given to the question that is under consideration.

==== Description of issues

Traditionally the study of groundwater has been categorised as examining either water quantity or quality; the former examining the amount of groundwater flow and the latter examining the solutes dissolved in groundwater. However, the occurrence and use groundwater is much wider than this. For example as part of climate change mitigation, groundwater systems have been recognised as heat stores for ground source heat pumps and saline aquifers for the disposal of supercritical CO~2~.

_Groundwater flow_

Groundwater flow is important for supporting abstractions for water supply for domestic (i.e. people in their homes) as well as industrial purposes. It is also important to support river flows for ecological purposes, amenity value (people to enjoy their surroundings), etc. Groundwater dependent ecosystems, as the name suggests, are also supported by sub-surface flows. These include wetlands, which can be small areas fed by seeps to large nationally significant bodies.

_Pollution_

Aquifers are vulnerable to polluting activities. These include "catastrophic" events such as accidental spills, i.e. a road tanker crash, to diffuse pollution from agricultural activities. European countries have a long history of industrial activities and groundwater has been polluted from these processes. Understanding the vulnerability of groundwater systems to pollution from current activities and clean-up of aquifers from past activities is equally important. Polluted groundwater can contribute to pollution in rivers, lakes and the seas as well as causing hazards for activities such as mining, etc.

_Natural attenuation_

Reliance on natural attenuation processes (within the context of a carefully controlled and monitored site cleanup approach) to achieve site-specific remediation objectives within a time frame that is reasonable compared to that offered by other more active methods. The 'natural attenuation processes' that are at work in such a remediation approach include a variety of physical, chemical, or biological processes that, under favourable conditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume, or concentration of contaminants in soil or groundwater. These in-situ processes include biodegradation; dispersion; dilution; sorption; volatilization; radioactive decay; and chemical or biological stabilization, transformation, or destruction of contaminants.

_Saline aquifers_

Saline aquifers occur in a range of settings. Aquifers in close proximity to estuaries and the sea are often saline. Deep aquifers with old or "connate" waters are also often highly saline. Basins of internal drainage, where evaporation is the only outflow are highly saline. Saline intrusion is a problem where abstraction occurs in aquifers close to saline water bodies. Careful management has to be undertaken to avoid despoiling the systems permanently. However, deep saline aquifers are being considered for disposal of supercritical CO~2~. Finally highly saline aquifers that are the result of evaporative processes often contain economically important minerals and are exploited commercially.

_Geotechnical considerations_

The interaction of groundwater with the built environment is extremely important. As the water content or pore pressure of the ground changes so does its geotechnical properties. For example, rising groundwater in cities causes problems with deep foundations and tunnels. An understanding of water movement in the sub-surface is, therefore, important to ensure safe construction of buildings. Dewatering of aquifers for temporary works is also important to allow sub-water table working in construction works.

_Groundwater monitoring_

Groundwater, in view of its prevalence and quality is a very important source of supply for the population with drinking water. Because of its economic importance and the widespread risks to water quality caused by pollution discharged to the ground, it requires special protection. This protection is achieved, inter alia, by using amonitoring network for both qualitative and quantitative aspects of groundwater status.

_Geohazards_

As well as being a resource, groundwater can cause problems either by appearing at the surface or by entering sub-surface structures. Groundwater flooding is one such problem. Under extreme recharge events, the water table can rise to the surface and result in flooding. Groundwater flooding differs from surface water flooding in that it is often long-lasting, typically of the order of weeks to months and can affect areas not identified in traditional flood risk mapping. Unlike surface water floods, it is not possible to control this phenomenon easily by flood defences.

Other geohazards that are related to groundwater include:

• landslides

• swell-shrink clays

• subsidence

All of these geohazards need an assessment of water movement in the sub-surface to understand how they occur and what influence human activity and climate change will have on them.

_Heat_

Heat flows both into and out of aquifers are increasingly being recognised as a way of reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Groundwater systems and aquifers are being developed to be used as a temporary store for heat. Systems may be based on pumping groundwater into and out of an aquifer using boreholes, such as Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHP), or heat exchange in trenches or boreholes for Ground Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHP). Groundwater can also be used to exploit hotter rocks close to the surface by pumping cold water down or abstracting hot water. These systems can be used to heat, cool and power systems in buildings. Where very elevated groundwater temperatures are found, electricity generation is possible.

_Mineral resources_

Exploitation of mineral resources requires the control of water where it isn't wanted and supply of water where it is in short supply. So-called "wet working" of mines requires removal of water where it enters the mine. However mining requires water to operate its processes so in some areas, where water is scare, then groundwater can be used for supply purposes. Groundwater can be rich in minerals and the economic extraction of minerals from groundwaters is possible for high value minerals such as Lithium. As well as this mineral waters can be thought of groundwater as an economic resource, with the dissolved solids giving the water its taste, e.g. bottled waters.

==== Approach to data models

image::./media/image63.png[aq-system,width=450,height=234]

[.text-center]
*Fig. 5 Example of an aquifer system*

The Aquifer System is dependent of rock properties such as permeability and porosity for water flow and storage. Generally the two main components are Aquifers (e.g. sand and gravel) where water flow is may easily occur and Aquitards, which are poorly permeable formations (e.g. clay) that do not yield water freely to a well or a spring. However, an aquitard may transmit appreciable water to or from adjacent aquifers.

image::./media/image64.png[wb-system,width=447,height=257]

[.text-center]
*Fig. 6 Example of a groundwater flow system*

The aquifer system provides a framework for the groundwater flow system and encompasses it. The nature of the groundwater flow system depends partly on the aquifer system but also on factors such as the geometry of the water table (or confined potentiometric surface) and the location of discharge points such as rivers, springs and wells. Groundwater bodies are discrete bodies of groundwater lying within a groundwater flow system'.

The basic idea of the INSPIRE model for groundwater is to identify two basic elements: the Aquifer System (dependent on the geological conditions) and the Groundwater Flow System. Both components taken together create the Hydrogeological System.

image::./media/image65.png[hg-system,width=452,height=280]

[.text-center]
*Fig. 7 Example of an hydrogeological system*

The mutual relationships between those components create and build the condition for groundwater flow. The main assessment of model is base on the hydrodynamic processes (groundwater flow).

==== Relevant EU legislation

There is a significant amount of EU legislation that impacts on groundwater systems and their management. The following provides a list of the relevant EU legislation.
