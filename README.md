The purpose of this repository is host the INSPIRE Technical Guidance documents (hereafter INSPIRE TG) and manage the changes to them. This repository is setup within [Action 2.3](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/Action+2.3+Simplification+of+INSPIRE+implementation) of the [INSPIRE MIWP 2021-2024](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24).

The INSPIRE TG will be converted from the current pdf format to the markdown format and published in this repository. The first TG will be available soon.

A governance and release process for managing the changes to the INSPIRE TG will be made available soon, and will be similar to [the one for the INSPIRE XSD application schemas](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/application-schemas/blob/main/governance-release-process/process.md). Change proposals to the current version of the INSPIRE TG can be proposed and discussed in the issue tracker of this repository. These change proposals will then be subject to the specific governance and release process, once available.

Please follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) anytime when you interact with the INSPIRE community in this space.
