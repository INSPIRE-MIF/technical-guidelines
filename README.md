# INSPIRE Technical Guidance documents

The purpose of this repository is to host the INSPIRE Technical Guidance documents (hereafter INSPIRE TGs) and manage the changes to them.

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/technical-guidelines/issues) of this repository should only be used to submit and discuss change proposals to the TGs. Any questions relating to the use of the TGs or relating to general INSPIRE matters should be posted in the [INSPIRE helpdesk](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk). 

The INSPIRE TGs describe detailed implementation aspects and relations with existing standards, technologies, and practices, see also https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/inspire-technical-guidance/57753.

## Status

All INSPIRE TGs will be converted from the [current pdf format](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/Technical-guidelines3) to the Markdown or AsciiDoc format and published in this repository. Currently, the [TG metadata](/metadata/metadata-iso19139/metadata-iso19139.adoc) has been converted.

## Governance and release process

Change proposals to the TGs can be proposed and discussed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/technical-guidelines/issues) of this repository. These change proposals are then subject to the specific governance and release process, whose workflow and actors involved are detailed in [this document](/governance-release-process/process.md).
