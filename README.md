# INSPIRE Techncial Guidance documents

The purpose of this repository is host the INSPIRE Technical Guidance documents (hereafter INSPIRE TGs) and manage the changes to them.

The INSPIRE TGs describe detailed implementation aspects and relations with existing standards, technologies, and practices, see also https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/inspire-technical-guidance/57753.

## Status

The INSPIRE TGs will be converted from the [current pdf format](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/Technical-guidelines3) to the markdown format and published in this repository. The first TG will be available here soon.

## Governance and release process

Change proposals to the TGs can be proposed and discussed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/technical-guidelines/issues) of this repository. These change proposals are then subject to the specific governance and release process, whose workflow and actors involved are detailed in [this document](/governance-release-process/process.md).
